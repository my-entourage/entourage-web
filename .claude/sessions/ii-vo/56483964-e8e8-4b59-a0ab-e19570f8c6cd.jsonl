You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/shared/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/shared/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/shared/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If a Linear ticket is mentioned, use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For related tickets:**\n   - **linear-searcher** - To find similar issues or past implementations\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n4. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n     - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n     - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n     - description is a brief kebab-case description\n   - Examples:\n     - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n     - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-improve-error-handling.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n````markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/shared/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n````\n\n### Step 5: Review\n\n1. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n2. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n3. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n   - automated steps should use `make` whenever possible - for example `make -C humanlayer-wui check` instead of `cd humanlayer-wui && bun run fmt`\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - If the ticket mentions \"WUI\", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory\n   - If it mentions \"daemon\", specify `hld/` directory\n   - Never use generic terms like \"UI\" when you mean \"WUI\"\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /create_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/shared/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...\n\n[Interactive process continues...]\n```\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"966539be-b5d2-4768-820b-6290f3b5cba1","timestamp":"2025-12-27T03:28:51.040Z"}

Clerk authentication as the signing provider with authenticated dashboard pages\n2. Supabase for storing waitlist signups\n3. Resend for sending email notifications to `iivo.angerpuro@gmail.com`\n4. Using ShadCN UI components with wrapper pattern for brand consistency\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Entourage codebase is a Next.js 16 marketing landing page with no authentication, backend, or forms currently implemented. The project uses a \"Technical Blueprint\" design system with sharp corners (rounded-none), monochrome palette, and signature Plus Corner elements.\n\n**Current state:**\n- Login button in Header links to non-existent `/sign-in`\n- Waitlist CTA links to non-existent `/sign-up`\n- Only ShadCN component installed: Accordion (with branded wrapper)\n- No form inputs, no validation libraries, no backend integration\n\n**Integration approach:**\n- Clerk: Use ClerkProvider with custom appearance matching design system\n- Supabase: Database-only for waitlist (no Supabase auth)\n- Resend: Simple notification emails on waitlist signup\n- ShadCN: Add Input, Label, Form components with branded wrappers\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1. Current Codebase State\n\n#### Header Component (`src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx`)\n\nThe Header contains a login button that links to `/sign-in`:\n\n```tsx\n// Lines 52-56\n<Link href=\"/sign-in\">\n  <Button variant=\"secondary\" size=\"default\">\n    Login\n  </Button>\n</Link>\n```\n\nButton uses `secondary` variant: transparent bg, black/white border, rounded-none.\n\n#### Hero CTA (`src/components/sections/hero/Hero.tsx`)\n\n```tsx\n// Lines 63-68\n<Link href=\"/sign-up\">\n  <Button variant=\"solid\" size=\"lg\">\n    Join the Waitlist\n  </Button>\n</Link>\n```\n\nUses `solid` variant: black bg with white text (inverted in dark mode).\n\n#### ShadCN Configuration (`components.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"baseColor\": \"zinc\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Existing Wrapper Pattern (`src/components/Accordion.tsx`)\n\nThe project uses a wrapper pattern for ShadCN components:\n\n```tsx\nexport function AccordionItem({ className, ...props }: AccordionItemProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnAccordionItem\n      className={cn(\n        \"rounded-none border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 px-4\",\n        className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Install ShadCN component to `components/ui/`\n2. Create wrapper in `components/` root\n3. Apply brand styling via `cn()` className merge\n4. Export wrapper for use throughout app\n\n### Clerk Customization Strategy\n\nUse `appearance` prop with:\n- `cssLayerName: 'clerk'` for Tailwind v4 compatibility\n- `variables` for theme-level styling (colors, fonts, radii)\n- `elements` for fine-grained component styling with Tailwind classes\n\n---\n\n## External Resources\n\n### Clerk\n- [Clerk Next.js Quickstart](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)\n- [clerkMiddleware() Reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware)\n- [Appearance Prop Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/overview)\n- [Tailwind CSS v4 Support](https://clerk.com/changelog/2025-06-17-css-layer-name)\n\n### Supabase\n- [Supabase Next.js Quickstart](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/nextjs)\n- [Waitlist Tutorial](https://tinloof.com/blog/how-to-build-a-waitlist-with-supabase-and-next-js)\n- [DEV Community Waitlist Guide](https://dev.to/charanx/how-to-create-a-simple-waitlist-form-in-nextjs-using-supabase-to-collect-responses-4dpe)\n\n### Resend\n- [Resend + Next.js Guide](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nextjs)\n- [React Email Templates](https://react.email/templates)\n- [Domain Verification](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction)\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. **Clerk vs Waitlist flow**: Should the waitlist form be a separate flow from Clerk sign-up? Current plan treats them separately.\n\n2. **Domain verification**: Resend requires domain verification for production. The `onboarding@resend.dev` sender works for testing only.\n\n3. **Supabase + Clerk integration**: If later you want Clerk users synced to Supabase, consider Clerk's Supabase integration via webhooks.\n\n4. **Dashboard content**: The empty dashboard is a placeholder. What features should it display?\n","numLines":758,"startLine":1,"totalLines":758}}}

However, using `+` text for list markers is fine - it's different from the Plus Corner decoration.\n\n3. **Hero subheadline color** (line 58): Uses `text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500` which matches the design system's \"Hero Subheadline (muted)\" pattern.\n   \nI notice several additional design system alignments. Section labels precisely follow the prescribed `text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500` specification. Body text adheres to the recommended `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` color scheme. Card borders and dashed frames consistently match the design system's defined border colors for both light and dark modes.\n\nThe page demonstrates careful attention to typography and color consistency across different elements, with only minor deviations from the established design system guidelines.\n\nThe section padding uses standard responsive spacing with `mt-16 md:mt-24`, maintaining visual hierarchy. The primary call-to-action (mailto link) employs solid button styling appropriately. Hero section padding follows a precise responsive pattern, ensuring visual balance across different device sizes.\n\nA single recommended adjustment involves updating the hero headline's mobile breakpoint text size to `md:text-6xl` for optimal readability and design alignment.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2550,"cache_read_input_tokens":82156,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2550,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWWVWAhy96KXqTxA5viBz","type":"assistant","uuid":"a5a7d88d-77be-40b9-a6d0-6af4ff74d0af","timestamp":"2025-12-27T03:36:37.498Z"}
