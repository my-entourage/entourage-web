These handoffs contain critical context, learnings, and next steps from previous work sessions that need to be understood and continued.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **If the path to a handoff document was provided**:\n   - If a handoff document path was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read the handoff document FULLY\n   - Immediately read any research or plan documents that it links to under `thoughts/shared/plans` or `thoughts/shared/research`. do NOT use a sub-agent to read these critical files.\n   - Begin the analysis process by ingesting relevant context from the handoff document, reading additional files it mentions\n   - Then propose a course of action to the user and confirm, or ask for clarification on direction.\n\n2. **If a ticket number (like ENG-XXXX) was provided**:\n   - run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to ensure your `thoughts/` directory is up to date.\n   - locate the most recent handoff document for the ticket. Tickets will be located in `thoughts/shared/handoffs/ENG-XXXX` where `ENG-XXXX` is the ticket number. e.g. for `ENG-2124` the handoffs would be in `thoughts/shared/handoffs/ENG-2124/`. **List this directory's contents.**\n   - There may be zero, one or multiple files in the directory.\n   - **If there are zero files in the directory, or the directory does not exist**: tell the user: \"I'm sorry, I can't seem to find that handoff document. Can you please provide me with a path to it?\"\n   - **If there is only one file in the directory**: proceed with that handoff\n   - **If there are multiple files in the directory**: using the date and time specified in the file name (it will be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` in 24-hour time format), proceed with the _most recent_ handoff document.\n   - Immediately read the handoff document FULLY\n   - Immediately read any research or plan documents that it links to under `thoughts/shared/plans` or `thoughts/shared/research`; do NOT use a sub-agent to read these critical files.\n   - Begin the analysis process by ingesting relevant context from the handoff document, reading additional files it mentions\n   - Then propose a course of action to the user and confirm, or ask for clarification on direction.\n\n3. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you resume work from a handoff document. Let me find the available handoffs.\n\nWhich handoff would you like to resume from?\n\nTip: You can invoke this command directly with a handoff path: `/resume_handoff `thoughts/shared/handoffs/ENG-XXXX/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_ENG-XXXX_description.md`\n\nor using a ticket number to resume from the most recent handoff for that ticket: `/resume_handoff ENG-XXXX`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Read and Analyze Handoff\n\n1. **Read handoff document completely**:\n   - Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters\n   - Extract all sections:\n     - Task(s) and their statuses\n     - Recent changes\n     - Learnings\n     - Artifacts\n     - Action items and next steps\n     - Other notes\n\n2. **Spawn focused research tasks**:\n   Based on the handoff content, spawn parallel research tasks to verify current state:\n\n   ```\n   Task 1 - Gather artifact context:\n   Read all artifacts mentioned in the handoff.\n   1. Read feature documents listed in \"Artifacts\"\n   2. Read implementation plans referenced\n   3. Read any research documents mentioned\n   4. Extract key requirements and decisions\n   Use tools: Read\n   Return: Summary of artifact contents and key decisions\n   ```\n\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n4. **Read critical files identified**:\n   - Read files from \"Learnings\" section completely\n   - Read files from \"Recent changes\" to understand modifications\n   - Read any new related files discovered during research\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize and Present Analysis\n\n1. **Present comprehensive analysis**:\n   ```\n   I've analyzed the handoff from [date] by [researcher]. Here's the current situation:\n\n   **Original Tasks:**\n   - [Task 1]: [Status from handoff] → [Current verification]\n   - [Task 2]: [Status from handoff] → [Current verification]\n\n   **Key Learnings Validated:**\n   - [Learning with file:line reference] - [Still valid/Changed]\n   - [Pattern discovered] - [Still applicable/Modified]\n\n   **Recent Changes Status:**\n   - [Change 1] - [Verified present/Missing/Modified]\n   - [Change 2] - [Verified present/Missing/Modified]\n\n   **Artifacts Reviewed:**\n   - [Document 1]: [Key takeaway]\n   - [Document 2]: [Key takeaway]\n\n   **Recommended Next Actions:**\n   Based on the handoff's action items and current state:\n   1. [Most logical next step based on handoff]\n   2. [Second priority action]\n   3. [Additional tasks discovered]\n\n   **Potential Issues Identified:**\n   - [Any conflicts or regressions found]\n   - [Missing dependencies or broken code]\n\n   Shall I proceed with [recommended action 1], or would you like to adjust the approach?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get confirmation** before proceeding\n\n### Step 3: Create Action Plan\n\n1. **Use TodoWrite to create task list**:\n   - Convert action items from handoff into todos\n   - Add any new tasks discovered during analysis\n   - Prioritize based on dependencies and handoff guidance\n\n2. **Present the plan**:\n   ```\n   I've created a task list based on the handoff and current analysis:\n\n   [Show todo list]\n\n   Ready to begin with the first task: [task description]?\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Begin Implementation\n\n1. **Start with the first approved task**\n2. **Reference learnings from handoff** throughout implementation\n3. **Apply patterns and approaches documented** in the handoff\n4. **Update progress** as tasks are completed\n\n## Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Thorough in Analysis**:\n   - Read the entire handoff document first\n   - Verify ALL mentioned changes still exist\n   - Check for any regressions or conflicts\n   - Read all referenced artifacts\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Present findings before starting work\n   - Get buy-in on the approach\n   - Allow for course corrections\n   - Adapt based on current state vs handoff state\n\n3. **Leverage Handoff Wisdom**:\n   - Pay special attention to \"Learnings\" section\n   - Apply documented patterns and approaches\n   - Avoid repeating mistakes mentioned\n   - Build on discovered solutions\n\n4. **Track Continuity**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to maintain task continuity\n   - Reference the handoff document in commits\n   - Document any deviations from original plan\n   - Consider creating a new handoff when done\n\n5. **Validate Before Acting**:\n   - Never assume handoff state matches current state\n   - Verify all file references still exist\n   - Check for breaking changes since handoff\n   - Confirm patterns are still valid\n\n## Common Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Clean Continuation\n- All changes from handoff are present\n- No conflicts or regressions\n- Clear next steps in action items\n- Proceed with recommended actions\n\n### Scenario 2: Diverged Codebase\n- Some changes missing or modified\n- New related code added since handoff\n- Need to reconcile differences\n- Adapt plan based on current state\n\n### Scenario 3: Incomplete Handoff Work\n- Tasks marked as \"in_progress\" in handoff\n- Need to complete unfinished work first\n- May need to re-understand partial implementations\n- Focus on completing before new work\n\n### Scenario 4: Stale Handoff\n- Significant time has passed\n- Major refactoring has occurred\n- Original approach may no longer apply\n- Need to re-evaluate strategy\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /resume_handoff specification/feature/handoffs/handoff-0.md\nAssistant: Let me read and analyze that handoff document...\n\n[Reads handoff completely]\n[Spawns research tasks]\n[Waits for completion]\n[Reads identified files]\n\nI've analyzed the handoff from [date]. Here's the current situation...\n\n[Presents analysis]\n\nShall I proceed with implementing the webhook validation fix, or would you like to adjust the approach?\n\nUser: Yes, proceed with the webhook validation\nAssistant: [Creates todo list and begins implementation]\n```\n\n\nARGUMENTS: thoughts/shared/handoffs/ENT-48/2025-12-25_15-39-26_ENT-48_context-find-command.md"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"a283bc50-b680-4911-9293-c0efcc2de629","timestamp":"2025-12-25T07:42:05.677Z","sourceToolUseID":"toolu_01X5s1tEWehkByoe6g3S26Wn"}

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n- **Pause for human verification**: After completing all automated verification for a phase, pause and inform the human that the phase is ready for manual testing. Use this format:\n  ```\n  Phase [N] Complete - Ready for Manual Verification\n\n  Automated verification passed:\n  - [List automated checks that passed]\n\n  Please perform the manual verification steps listed in the plan:\n  - [List manual verification items from the plan]\n\n  Let me know when manual testing is complete so I can proceed to Phase [N+1].\n  ```\n\nIf instructed to execute multiple phases consecutively, skip the pause until the last phase. Otherwise, assume you are just doing one phase.\n\ndo not check off items in the manual testing steps until confirmed by the user.\n\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"e5626063-2edf-42a4-973d-9b5e7deef19f","timestamp":"2025-12-25T07:46:11.961Z"}

Merge the PR\n\nLet me just commit the plan file changes.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":741,"cache_read_input_tokens":60753,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":741,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWT4kU2yybchCxaRtAMEP","type":"assistant","uuid":"53ca2a43-027e-49a4-9c81-fd3a788b9f72","timestamp":"2025-12-25T08:09:59.108Z"}
