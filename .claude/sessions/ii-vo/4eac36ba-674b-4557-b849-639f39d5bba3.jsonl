You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/shared/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/shared/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/shared/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If a Linear ticket is mentioned, use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For related tickets:**\n   - **linear-searcher** - To find similar issues or past implementations\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n4. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n     - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n     - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n     - description is a brief kebab-case description\n   - Examples:\n     - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n     - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-improve-error-handling.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n````markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/shared/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n````\n\n### Step 5: Review\n\n1. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n2. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n3. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n   - automated steps should use `make` whenever possible - for example `make -C humanlayer-wui check` instead of `cd humanlayer-wui && bun run fmt`\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - If the ticket mentions \"WUI\", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory\n   - If it mentions \"daemon\", specify `hld/` directory\n   - Never use generic terms like \"UI\" when you mean \"WUI\"\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /create_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/shared/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon.

Identity Crisis\n\n  The \"Digital Swiss Style\" claim is unearned.\n\n  The guide invokes Swiss Design principles (objectivity, precision, grid systems) but then:\n  - Uses a gimmicky \"Plus Corner\" motif as a signature element — Swiss Design abhors decorative flourishes\n  - References Vercel/Linear/Stripe aesthetic — these are distinct visual languages, not Swiss Style\n  - The Plus Corner system is pure decoration masquerading as \"measurement markers\" — actual technical drawings don't use decorative corner markers\n\n  Verdict: Pick a lane. Either commit to austere Swiss minimalism or own that you're building a trendy tech startup look.\n\n  ---\n  2. The Plus Corner System is Overengineered Noise\n\n  - 515 lines dedicated to explaining how to put 4 plus signs on a box\n  - An \"opacity tier\" system (50%, 100%, 100%+scale) for decoration\n  - Staggered reveal animations for static decorative elements\n  - An entire \"exclusion list\" of where NOT to use them\n\n  This screams design system bloat. If you need 50+ lines explaining when NOT to use an element, the element is too complex.\n\n  The irony: The guide says \"Every element serves a purpose. No decoration for decoration's sake\" then dedicates an entire section to decorative corner markers.\n\n  ---\n  3. Color System is Timid and Contradictory\n\n  The palette:\n  Black, White, and... 9 shades of Zinc gray\n\n  - Claims \"colors are functional signals, not decoration\"\n  - Then provides semantic colors (Green, Purple, Yellow, Orange, Red) that are...stock Tailwind palette colors\n  - No brand color whatsoever\n  - Green (#48BB78) for success is literally Tailwind's green-400\n\n  This is a non-brand. Any company could use this palette. There's nothing distinctive here.\n\n  Missing: Where's your actual brand differentiation? Purple for \"AI action\" is the same purple every AI company uses. Original thinking: zero.\n\n  ---\n  4. Typography Choices are Safe to the Point of Boring\n\n  - Switzer: A perfectly fine, completely unremarkable geometric sans\n  - Geist Mono: The same mono font half the tech industry uses\n\n  No typographic personality. No hierarchy drama. The type scale is just...Tailwind's default scale with labels attached.\n\n  The spacing guidance:\n  All spacing snaps to an 8px grid.\n  This is literally just \"use rem values\" with extra words.\n\n  ---\n  5. Animation Philosophy vs Reality\n\n  The guide preaches:\n  \"Animations should inform, not entertain\"\n\n  Then documents:\n  - Logo pulse animations (2-3s)\n  - Circuit signal animations (3-5s)\n  - Infinite scroll carousels (20-25s)\n  - Staggered Plus Corner reveal animations\n\n  None of these \"inform\" anything. They're pure visual entertainment.\n\n  ---\n  6. Shadow System Doesn't Match the Aesthetic\n\n  You can't claim \"blueprint aesthetic favors flat design\" and then provide 5+ shadow tokens with complex multi-layer definitions. Pick one:\n  - Flat/sharp/blueprint = no shadows\n  - Soft/elevated = shadows\n\n  The guide tries to have both and achieves neither.\n\n  ---\n  7. Component Examples are Derivative\n\n  The Button, Dialog, Table, and Toast examples are literally just ShadcnUI with:\n  - rounded-none added\n  - Color variables swapped\n\n  There's no actual design thinking here. It's theme-swapping, not design system creation.\n\n  ---\n  8. \"Voice & Tone\" Section is Ironic\n\n  The guide says:\n  \"No marketing fluff\"\n\n  The entire Plus Corner section IS marketing fluff dressed as technical documentation:\n  \"derived from technical blueprints where plus marks indicate measurement points\"\n\n  This is post-hoc rationalization for a decorative choice. Real blueprint measurement marks don't look like this.\n\n  ---\n  9. Accessibility is an Afterthought\n\n  - Listed last\n  - Minimal actual guidance\n  - \"Black on white, high contrast palette\" — this isn't a strategy, it's a tautology\n  - No color blindness considerations\n  - No actual contrast ratio testing documented\n  - No cognitive accessibility considerations\n\n  ---\n  10. Documentation Overhead\n\n  This guide is 1,550 lines for what amounts to:\n  - Black and white color scheme\n  - No border radius\n  - Plus signs in corners\n  - Zinc grays\n  - Standard Tailwind spacing\n\n  The ratio of documentation to actual design decisions is grotesque.\n\n  ---\n  Summary of Critiques\n\n  | Category      | Issue                                                               |\n  |---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n  | Identity      | Confused positioning between Swiss Style and Tech Startup aesthetic |\n  | Plus Corners  | Overengineered decoration that contradicts stated principles        |\n  | Color         | No brand identity, stock palette, semantic colors are clichés       |\n  | Typography    | Safe/generic choices with no distinctive personality                |\n  | Animation     | Philosophy contradicts actual implementations                       |\n  | Shadows       | Incompatible with claimed \"flat/blueprint\" aesthetic                |\n  | Components    | Theme-swapping ShadcnUI, not original design                        |\n  | Voice         | Guide itself violates its \"no fluff\" principle                      |\n  | Accessibility | Minimal, afterthought treatment                                     |\n  | Documentation | Massive bloat for minimal design decisions                          |\n\n  ---\n  What World-Class Actually Looks Like\n\n  1. Commit to a real point of view — Swiss, Brutalist, OR soft/friendly — not all of them\n  2. One distinctive element, used sparingly — Not Plus Corners everywhere with a 50-line exclusion list\n  3. Actual brand color — Even one accent color creates memorability\n  4. Typographic tension — Contrast between font choices, not just \"serif vs mono\"\n  5. Subtract, don't add — This guide adds complexity where simplicity would serve better\n\n⏺ Design Guide Critique — Clean List\n\n  Identity & Philosophy\n\n  1. \"Digital Swiss Style\" is claimed but not executed — Swiss Design rejects decorative flourishes\n  2. Mixing three different inspirations (Vercel/Linear/Stripe) creates no distinct identity\n  3. Core principle \"no decoration for decoration's sake\" is violated by Plus Corner system\n  4. Post-hoc rationalization — Plus Corners aren't real blueprint measurement markers\n\n  Plus Corner System\n\n  5. 500+ lines to document putting 4 plus signs on a box\n  6. Three-tier opacity system for decoration is overengineering\n  7. Staggered reveal animations on static decorative elements\n  8. 50-line exclusion list signals the element is too complex\n  9. If you need to explain where NOT to use something this much, cut it\n\n  Color\n\n  10. Zero brand differentiation — any company could use this palette\n  11. Semantic colors are stock Tailwind values (#48BB78 is literally green-400)\n  12. Purple for \"AI action\" is the same cliché every AI startup uses\n  13. Nine shades of Zinc gray is not a color strategy\n\n  Typography\n\n  14. Switzer is unremarkable — no personality\n  15. Geist Mono is what half the tech industry already uses\n  16. Type scale is just Tailwind defaults with labels\n  17. No hierarchy drama or typographic tension\n  18. \"8px grid\" is just \"use rem\" with extra words\n\n  Animation\n\n  19. States \"animations should inform, not entertain\"\n  20. Then documents decorative pulses, circuit signals, infinite scrolls\n  21. None of these inform anything — pure visual entertainment\n  22. Philosophy and implementation directly contradict\n\n  Shadows\n\n  23. Claims \"blueprint aesthetic favors flat design\"\n  24. Provides 5+ shadow tokens with multi-layer definitions\n  25. Can't be both flat/sharp AND soft/elevated — pick one\n\n  Components\n\n  26. Button/Dialog/Table are just ShadcnUI with rounded-none\n  27. This is theme-swapping, not design system creation\n  28. No original design thinking visible\n\n  Accessibility\n\n  29. Listed last — clearly an afterthought\n  30. \"Black on white = high contrast\" is a tautology, not a strategy\n  31. No color blindness considerations\n  32. No contrast ratio testing documented\n  33. No cognitive accessibility guidance\n\n  Documentation\n\n  34. 1,550 lines for: black/white + no radius + zinc grays + plus signs\n  35. Ratio of documentation to actual decisions is absurd\n  36. Quick reference cards duplicate information already stated\n  37. Version history padding (5 versions in 2 days)\n\n  Voice & Tone\n\n  38. \"No marketing fluff\" — then Plus Corner section is pure marketing fluff\n  39. Guide violates its own stated principles\n  40. Rationalizes decoration as function without evidence\n\n  ---\n  Core problem: This guide documents complexity, not clarity. A world-class design system makes fewer decisions with more conviction. Separate the concerns into categories and ask me questions if you're unsure about anything or if there are some design decisions to be made.

The system features a distinctive **Plus Corner** motif that appears throughout the interface.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Objectivity** | Information over emotion. Let the data speak. |\n| **Precision** | Grid-based layouts, consistent spacing, sharp corners. |\n| **Clarity** | High contrast, readable typography, functional color. |\n| **Density** | Information-rich interfaces that respect the user's time. |\n| **Functionality** | Every element serves a purpose. No decoration for decoration's sake. |\n\n### Design Inspiration\n\n| Source | What We Borrow |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Vercel** | Technical precision, blueprint aesthetics, developer focus |\n| **Linear** | Dense information display, keyboard-first, monospace accents |\n| **Stripe** | Clear hierarchy, professional polish, trustworthiness |\n\n### The \"Technical Blueprint\" Aesthetic\n\nThink of Entourage's interface as a technical drawing:\n- Sharp corners (0px radius everywhere)\n- Dashed/dotted borders as construction guides\n- Plus signs (+) as measurement markers\n- Monospace text for data and labels\n- High contrast black/white with functional color accents\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n| Category | Technology |\n|----------|------------|\n| Framework | Next.js 16, React 19 |\n| Components | ShadcnUI (base) → Custom wrappers |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |\n| Animation | Framer Motion |\n| Icons | Iconify (Lucide primary, Simple Icons for brands) |\n| Fonts | Switzer (UI), Geist Mono (code/data) |\n\n---\n\n## Color System\n\n### Design Methodology\n\nColors are **functional signals**, not decoration. We use a strictly monochromatic base with semantic colors for status only.\n\n### Primary Palette: Monochrome\n\n```css\n/* Core — Brand foundation */\n--color-black:       #000000;   /* Primary text, borders (light mode) */\n--color-white:       #FFFFFF;   /* Backgrounds (light mode) */\n```\n\n### Gray Scale (Zinc)\n\n| Token | Hex | Light Mode Use | Dark Mode Use |\n|-------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| **zinc-50** | #FAFAFA | Subtle backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-100** | #F4F4F5 | Section backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-200** | #E4E4E7 | Dashed borders | — |\n| **zinc-300** | #D4D4D8 | Dotted borders, input borders | — |\n| **zinc-400** | #A1A1AA | Plus corners, labels | — |\n| **zinc-500** | #71717A | Muted text | Body text |\n| **zinc-600** | #52525B | — | Plus corners |\n| **zinc-700** | #3F3F46 | — | Dotted borders |\n| **zinc-800** | #27272A | — | Dashed borders |\n| **zinc-900** | #18181B | — | Backgrounds |\n\n### Semantic Colors (Status Only)\n\nColors communicate state, not brand. Use sparingly and always pair with context.\n\n| Status | Hex | RGB | Use |\n|--------|-----|-----|-----|\n| **Green** | #48BB78 | 72, 187, 120 | Success, complete, active |\n| **Purple** | #9F7AEA | 159, 122, 234 | AI action, processing |\n| **Yellow** | #F6E05E | 246, 224, 94 | Warning, pending review |\n| **Orange** | #ED8936 | 237, 137, 54 | In progress, working |\n| **Red** | #F56565 | 245, 101, 101 | Error, failed, destructive |\n\n### Color Pairing Rules\n\n| Context | Background | Text | Border | Hover BG |\n|---------|------------|------|--------|----------|\n| **Page (light)** | white | black | — | — |\n| **Page (dark)** | black | white | — | — |\n| **Card (light)** | white | black | black or zinc-300 | zinc-50 |\n| **Card (dark)** | black | white | white or zinc-700 |

(dark)** | — | zinc-600 | — | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (light)** | — | — | zinc-200 | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (dark)** | — | — | zinc-800 | — |\n\n### Color Application Rules\n\n1. **Never use color decoratively** — Every color must have semantic meaning\n2. **Pair color with context** — A colored element alone isn't enough; add text or icon\n3. **Use tints for backgrounds** — Full color for

xl: |\n\n---\n\n## Shadow System\n\n### Philosophy\n\nShadows in Entourage are **minimal and purposeful**. The blueprint aesthetic favors flat design, but subtle shadows can indicate elevation when needed.\n\n### Shadow Tokens\n\n```css\n/* Light mode shadows */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n\n/* Dark mode shadows (deeper, less visible) */\n--shadow-card-dark: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n--shadow-card-hover-dark: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n--shadow-lg-dark: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\n### Shadow Usage\n\n| Element | Shadow | Use Case |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Buttons** | none | Flat by default (use borders) |\n| **Cards at rest** | shadow-sm or none | Minimal elevation |\n| **Cards on hover** | shadow-card-hover | Subtle lift effect |\n| **Dropdowns** | shadow-lg | Floating above content |\n| **Modals** | shadow-xl | Highest elevation |\n| **Toasts** | shadow-lg | Notification prominence |\n\n### When to Use Shadows\n\n**Use shadows for:**\n- Floating elements (dropdowns, popovers, modals)\n- Interactive card hover states\n- Toast notifications\n\n**Avoid shadows on:**\n- Static cards (prefer borders)\n- Buttons (use border states)\n- Navigation elements\n- Within the main content flow\n\n---\n\n## Plus Corner System\n\n### Concept\n\nThe Plus Corner is Entourage's **signature decorative element** — four plus signs (+) that mark the corners of featured containers. This is derived from technical blueprints where plus marks indicate measurement points.\n\n```\n   +───────────────────────────+\n   ╎                           ╎\n   ╎     Content Area          ╎\n   ╎                           ╎\n   +───────────────────────────+\n```\n\n### Plus Corner Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Specifications\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Size | 20px × 20px (w-5 h-5) |\n| Position offset | 10px from corner (-top-2.5 -left-2.5) |\n| Stroke width | 1px |\n| Color (light) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Color (dark) | zinc-600 (#52525B) |\n\n### Opacity Tiers\n\nThree-tier system for consistent application:\n\n| Tier | Opacity | Use Case |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| **Subtle** | 50% (opacity-50) | Background decoration, static frames |\n| **Default** | 100% | Standard cards, featured sections |\n| **Emphasis** | 100% + scale | Hover states with slight grow effect |\n\n### Animation (Staggered Reveal)\n\nFor enhanced interactivity, Plus Corners can animate in with a stagger effect:\n\n```css\n.plus-corner {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.8);\n  transition:\n    opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1),\n    transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n}\n\n/* Stagger delays */\n.plus-corner--tl { transition-delay: 0ms; }\n.plus-corner--tr { transition-delay: 50ms; }\n.plus-corner--bl { transition-delay: 100ms; }\n.plus-corner--br { transition-delay: 150ms; }\n\n/* Visible state */\n.group:hover .plus-corner {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1);\n}\n\n/* Reduced motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .plus-corner {\n    transition: opacity 0ms;\n    transform: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Hover Enhancement (Optional)\n\nFor interactive cards, Plus Corners can subtly shift color on hover:\n\n```tsx\n<PlusCorner\n  className={cn(\n    \"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5\",\n    \"text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    \"transition-colors duration-150\",\n    \"group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\n### Full Implementation\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function PlusCornerCard({\n  children,\n  className,\n  dashed = true,\n  interactive = false\n}: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  const cornerClass = cn(\n    \"absolute w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        \"group relative\",\n        dashed\n          ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n          : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n        \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### SVG Implementation (Embedded Graphics)\n\nWhen Plus Corners appear inside an SVG:\n\n```svg\n<g class=\"stroke-zinc-400 dark:stroke-zinc-600\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\">\n  <!-- Plus at position (x, y) with 5px arms -->\n  <path d=\"M x y-5 v 10 M x-5 y h 10\" />\n</g>\n```\n\n### Exclusion List (When NOT to Use)\n\nDo **not** apply Plus Corners to:\n\n| Element | Reason |\n|---------|--------|\n| Body text/paragraphs | Decorative noise |\n| Icons | Too small, cluttered |\n| Inline links | Disrupts reading flow |\n| Buttons | Use border states instead |\n| Navigation items | Use underline/color |\n| Toast notifications | Keep minimal |\n| Tooltips | Too small |\n| Very small components (< 80px) | Corners overwhelm content |\n| Footer | Keep simple |\n| Form inputs | Use focus states |\n\n### Application Contexts\n\n| Element | Plus Corners | Style |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **Hero section** | Yes | Dashed border + corners |\n| **Feature cards** | Yes | Dashed or solid |\n| **Bento grid items** | Yes | Default opacity |\n| **Images/media frames** | Yes, subtle | 50% opacity |\n| **Section dividers** | Optional | At endpoints only |\n| **Buttons** | No | — |\n| **Inputs** | No | — |\n\n---\n\n## Borders & Dividers\n\n### Border Styles\n\n| Type | Class | Use |\n|------|-------|-----|\n| **Solid** | `border` | Cards, buttons, primary containers |\n| **Dashed** | `border-dashed` | Featured frames, hero sections |\n| **Dotted** | `border-dotted` or SVG | Embedded graphics, construction guides |\n\n### Border Colors\n\n| Context | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| **Primary borders** | border-black | border-white |\n| **Card borders** | border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 |\n| **Dashed frames** | border-zinc-200 or border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 or border-zinc-800 |\n| **Subtle dividers** | border-zinc-200 | border-zinc-800 |\n\n### Border Width\n\n| Width | Class | Use |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| 1px | border | Standard borders |\n| 2px | border-2 | Emphasis, focus states |\n\n---\n\n## Components (ShadcnUI Patterns)\n\n### Component Wrapper Philosophy\n\n**Never edit ShadcnUI components directly.** Create wrapper components that apply brand styling.\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadcnUI primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx

{loading && <Loader2 className=\"mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin\" />}\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button States:**\n\n| State | Visual |\n|-------|--------|\n| Default | As specified by variant |\n| Hover | Background shifts (zinc-100/zinc-800) |\n| Focus | 2px black ring with offset |\n| Disabled | 50% opacity, not-allowed cursor |\n| Loading | Spinner icon, disabled state |\n\n**Button Usage:**\n\n| Context | Recommended Variant |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| Primary CTA (Join Waitlist) | solid |\n| Header navigation | secondary |\n| Card actions | primary |\n| Inline/tertiary actions | ghost |\n\n### Dialog (Modal)\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Dialog with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Dialog.tsx\nimport {\n  Dialog as ShadcnDialog,\n

className=\"text-green-600\">Complete</span>\n      </TableCell>\n    </TableRow>\n  </TableBody>\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Toast (Sonner)\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add sonner\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\nimport { Toaster } from \"@/components/ui/sonner\";\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <Toaster\n          position=\"bottom-right\"\n          toastOptions={{\n            className: cn(\n              \"rounded-none\",\n              \"border

*/}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Table Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function TableSkeleton({ rows = 5 }: { rows?: number }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white\">\n      <div className=\"border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 p-4\">\n        <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-32\" />\n

Let me analyze it objectively, comparing the actual content of the guide against the specific critiques made. I'll be fair to both sides.\n\nLet me go through each critique systematically:\n\n## 1. Identity Crisis / \"Digital Swiss Style\" claim\n\n**The Critique**: Claims Swiss Style but uses decorative Plus Corners, references Vercel/Linear/Stripe which are different visual languages.\n\n**My Assessment**: This critique has merit. Swiss Style (International Typographic Style) historically emphasized:\n- Asymmetric layouts\n- Sans-serif typefaces\n- Mathematical grids\n- Photography over illustration\n- **Rejection of ornamentation**\n\nThe Plus Corner system is decorative ornamentation. The guide acknowledges borrowing from Vercel/Linear/Stripe which are modern tech aesthetics, not pure Swiss Style.\n\nHowever, the guide says it's a \"modern interpretation\" - which is a fair framing. The critique may be overly purist about what Swiss Style means.\n\n**Verdict**: Partially valid. The \"Digital Swiss Style\" framing is aspirational rather than accurate. The guide would be more honest calling it \"technical/blueprint aesthetic with Swiss-inspired principles.\"\n\n## 2. Plus Corner System Overengineered\n\n**The Critique**: 500+ lines for 4 plus signs, three-tier opacity system, staggered animations, 50-line exclusion list.\n\n**My Assessment**: Looking at the actual guide:\n- Plus Corner section: Lines 360-562 = ~200 lines, not 500+\n- The exclusion list is a simple table, maybe 15 lines\n- The opacity tier system IS somewhat overengineered for decoration\n\nBut... documentation thoroughness isn't inherently bad. If this is the signature element, documenting all its uses makes sense.\n\nThe deeper point is valid though: If you need an exclusion list explaining where NOT to use something, you're probably overusing it. The \"no decoration for decoration's sake\" principle is indeed violated.\n\n\n**Verdict**: Valid core point, exaggerated specifics. The Plus Corner system does contradict the \"no decoration\" principle.\n\nThe color system critique reveals a nuanced design approach. While the palette appears restrained, this minimalism could be intentional. The monochromatic strategy suggests a focus on functional clarity over visual distinctiveness. Tailwind's default colors provide a neutral, adaptable foundation that prioritizes readability and consistency over bold brand expression.\n\nThe screenshot observation cuts deep - the design lacks memorable visual identity. Despite intentional constraints, the color system risks blending into a generic SaaS landscape, potentially undermining brand recognition.\n\n**Verdict**: Partially valid. The constraint is intentional but the lack of ANY brand differentiation is a weakness.\n\nThe typography critique exposes similar design conservatism. Switzer and Geist Mono represent safe, widely-used typefaces that communicate technical competence without personality. The type scale's adherence to Tailwind defaults further reinforces a design philosophy prioritizing utility over unique expression.\n\n**Verdict**: Valid. The typography choices are competent but unremarkable.\n\nThe animation philosophy reveals a stark inconsistency. While claiming \"inform not entertain\", the design documents logo pulses, circuit signals, and infinite scrolls that serve purely aesthetic purposes. These ambient animations contradict the stated design principle, functioning as decorative brand flourishes rather than meaningful interactions.\n\n**Verdict**: Valid. Clear contradiction between stated intent and actual implementation.\n\nThe shadow system exposes another design tension. Despite claiming a flat, blueprint-inspired aesthetic, the guide provides multiple shadow tokens. This suggests a nuanced approach to depth and elevation, allowing subtle shadows for specific interactive elements while maintaining an overall minimalist visual language.\n\nThe component strategy leverages ShadcnUI as a foundational framework, applying brand-specific styling through wrapper components. This pragmatic approach prioritizes efficiency over ground-up design, essentially theme-swapping rather than creating a comprehensive design system from scratch.\n\n**Verdict**: Partially valid. The implementation follows the guide's recommended pattern of component customization.\n\nThe Plus Corner design rationale reveals a post-hoc justification disconnected from actual technical blueprint practices. The decorative plus signs lack authentic measurement mark characteristics, representing more of a stylistic embellishment than a functional design element.\n\n**Verdict**: Valid. The explanation amounts to marketing fluff rather than substantive design reasoning.\n\nThe accessibility guidance appears minimal and surface-level, addressing only basic contrast and focus requirements while neglecting critical considerations like color blindness and cognitive accessibility needs.\n\n**Verdict**: Partially valid. The documentation provides rudimentary coverage but falls short of comprehensive accessibility standards.\n\nThe documentation's verbosity reflects a deliberate approach to supporting diverse developer audiences, particularly AI agents and newcomers who benefit from detailed explanatory examples. While the version history and quick reference cards introduce redundancy, they serve an educational purpose.\n\n**Verdict**: Partially valid. Comprehensive documentation represents a design choice prioritizing clarity over concision.\n\nKey critiques reveal fundamental inconsistencies: decorative elements contradict the \"no decoration\" principle, animation philosophy lacks coherence, and typography fails to convey distinctive personality. The voice section contains inherent irony, and color systems lack meaningful brand differentiation.\n\nThe core problem emerges: the guide documents complexity without genuine conviction, presenting aspirational principles that ultimately collapse under their own contradictions.\n\nPractical recommendations focus on strategic realignment: rename the aesthetic to something more technically precise, make decisive choices about decorative elements, introduce a singular accent color, and clarify design stance on shadows and accessibility. Documentation should be streamlined, removing redundant sections and focusing on clear, actionable guidance.","signature":"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

These are entertainment, not information. |\n| **No brand differentiation** | Black/white/zinc with Tailwind semantic colors. Nothing memorable. Any SaaS could use this palette. |\n| **Voice section irony** | \"Plus marks indicate measurement points\" is post-hoc rationalization. Blueprint measurement marks are tick marks or crosshairs, not decorative corner elements. |\n\n### **PARTIALLY VALID** (Fair point, but overstated)\n\n| Critique | My Take |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Plus Corner \"500+ lines\"** | Actually ~200 lines (360-562). Still a lot for decoration, but the number is exaggerated. |\n| **Components are derivative** | Yes, they're ShadcnUI + rounded-none. But that's the explicit intention per CLAUDE.md. For a startup, this is pragmatic, not a failure. |\n| **Shadow system contradiction** | The guide explicitly says shadows are for *floating* elements (dropdowns, modals) while static elements stay flat. This is a reasonable nuanced position. |\n| **Accessibility minimal** | The section does cover contrast, focus states, keyboard nav, touch targets, reduced motion. Missing: color blindness, cognitive load, actual contrast testing. Not absent, but thin. |\n| **Typography safe** | Switzer and Geist Mono are unremarkable but functional. Fair critique, but \"boring\" isn't always wrong—it can be intentional neutrality. |\n\n### **OVERSTATED** (Rhetorical flourish)\n\n- \"50-line exclusion list\" — It's a 12-row table\n- \"Grotesque documentation ratio\" — Detailed docs help AI agents and new devs\n- \"Version history padding\" — Admittedly silly but harmless\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions Required\n\nThe critique correctly identifies that the guide tries to be too many things. Here are the real decisions:\n\n### 1. **Identity: What are we actually?**\n\n| Option | Trade-off |\n|--------|-----------|\n| **Commit to austere Swiss** | Remove Plus Corners, all decorative animation, any non-functional elements |\n| **Own the tech startup look** | Keep Plus Corners, stop claiming Swiss Style, call it \"Blueprint Technical\" or \"Technical Precision\" |\n| **Hybrid with honesty** | Keep elements but reframe: \"Inspired by Swiss principles with modern tech flourishes\" |\n\n**Question**: Which identity do you actually want?\n\n### 2. **Plus Corners: Keep or cut?**\n\nThey violate the \"no decoration for decoration's sake\" principle. Two paths:\n\n| Keep | Cut |\n|------|-----|\n| They're your signature differentiator | They're decorative bloat |\n| Rewrite principle to allow \"intentional decoration for brand consistency\" | Be genuinely minimal |\n\n**Question**: Are Plus Corners worth the principle violation?\n\n### 3. **Brand color: Add one?**\n\nThe critique correctly notes there's nothing memorable. Even one accent color creates differentiation:\n- Vercel has the black/white but their *speed* theme is distinctive\n- Linear has purple\n- Stripe has the gradient system\n\n**Question**: Should Entourage have a single brand accent? If so, what feeling should it evoke?\n\n### 4. **Animation: Align with philosophy**\n\nEither:\n- Remove ambient animations (pulses, infinite scrolls) to match \"inform not entertain\"\n- Rewrite the philosophy to allow \"ambient brand presence\"\n\n**Question**: Should ambient animations stay or go?\n\n---\n\n## What I'd Recommend\n\n1. **Rename the aesthetic** → \"Technical Blueprint\" or \"Precision Interface\" — drop Swiss claims\n2. **Make a choice on Plus Corners** → Either own them as brand decoration (and update the principle) OR actually remove them\n3. **Consider one brand color** → Even if it's only used for CTAs or AI-related elements\n4. **Trim redundancy** → Remove the Quick Reference cards that duplicate earlier content\n5. **Expand accessibility** → Add actual contrast testing, color blindness considerations\n\nThe core insight of the critique is correct: **The guide documents complexity without conviction.** It hedges between multiple identities. A world-class design system picks a lane and commits.\n\nDo you want me to help you work through any of these decisions, or should I draft updates to the guide once you've decided on the direction?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":19040,"cache_read_input_tokens":28670,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":19040,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWVESLE6nwsJpTheHA5Ma","type":"assistant","uuid":"973f8adf-9d48-4206-865c-9aaebd741a64","timestamp":"2025-12-26T11:39:25.354Z"}

(CTAs, AI elements, brand moments, all of the above?)\n- Should it replace the semantic green for \"success\" or be separate?\n\nActually, looking at the current guide, green is already used semantically (#48BB78).

We use a strictly monochromatic base with semantic colors for status only.\n\n### Primary Palette: Monochrome\n\n```css\n/* Core — Brand foundation */\n--color-black:       #000000;   /* Primary text, borders (light mode) */\n--color-white:       #FFFFFF;   /* Backgrounds (light mode) */\n```\n\n### Gray Scale (Zinc)\n\n| Token | Hex | Light Mode Use | Dark Mode Use |\n|-------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| **zinc-50** | #FAFAFA | Subtle backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-100** | #F4F4F5 | Section backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-200** | #E4E4E7 | Dashed borders | — |\n| **zinc-300** | #D4D4D8 | Dotted borders, input borders | — |\n| **zinc-400** | #A1A1AA | Plus corners, labels | — |\n| **zinc-500** | #71717A | Muted text | Body text |\n| **zinc-600** | #52525B | — | Plus corners |\n| **zinc-700** | #3F3F46 | — | Dotted borders |\n| **zinc-800** | #27272A | — | Dashed borders |\n| **zinc-900** | #18181B | — | Backgrounds |\n\n### Semantic Colors (Status Only)\n\nColors communicate state, not brand. Use sparingly and always pair with context.\n\n| Status | Hex | RGB | Use |\n|--------|-----|-----|-----|\n| **Green** | #48BB78 | 72, 187, 120 | Success, complete, active |\n| **Purple** | #9F7AEA | 159, 122, 234 | AI action, processing |\n| **Yellow** | #F6E05E | 246, 224, 94 | Warning, pending review |\n| **Orange** | #ED8936 | 237, 137, 54 | In progress, working |\n| **Red** | #F56565 | 245, 101, 101 | Error, failed, destructive |\n\n### Color Pairing Rules\n\n| Context | Background | Text | Border | Hover BG |\n|---------|------------|------|--------|----------|\n| **Page (light)** | white | black | — | — |\n| **Page (dark)** | black | white | — | — |\n| **Card (light)** | white | black | black or zinc-300 | zinc-50 |\n| **Card (dark)** | black | white | white or zinc-700 |

decoratively** — Every color must have semantic meaning\n2. **Pair color with context** — A colored element alone isn't enough; add text or icon\n3. **Use tints for backgrounds** — Full color for text/borders, 10% opacity for backgrounds\n4. **Maintain contrast** — All text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)\n\n### CSS Variables (globals.css)\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode */\n  --background: #FFFFFF;\n  --foreground: #171717;\n  --card: #FFFFFF;\n  --card-foreground: #171717;\n  --primary: #171717;\n  --primary-foreground: #FAFAFA;\n  --secondary: #F5F5F5;\n

#737373;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Typography\n\n### Font Stack\n\n```css\n--font-sans: 'Switzer', system-ui, sans-serif;\n--font-mono: 'Geist Mono', 'Monaco', monospace;\n```\n\n### Font Loading\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\nconst switzer = localFont({\n  src: [\n    { path: \"./fonts/Switzer-Variable.woff2\", style: \"normal\" },\n    { path: \"./fonts/Switzer-VariableItalic.woff2\", style: \"italic\" },\n  ],\n  variable: \"--font-switzer\",\n  display: \"swap\",\n});\n\nconst geistMono = Geist_Mono({\n  variable: \"--font-geist-mono\",\n  subsets: [\"latin\"],\n});\n```\n\n### Type Scale\n\n| Size | Tailwind | Pixels | Use |\n|------|----------|--------|-----|\n| xs | text-xs | 12px | Labels, tags, metadata |\n| sm | text-sm | 14px | Secondary text, descriptions |\n| base | text-base | 16px | Body text, paragraphs |\n| lg | text-lg | 18px | Large body, card titles |\n| xl | text-xl | 20px | Section subtitles |\n| 2xl | text-2xl | 24px | Section headings (mobile) |\n| 3xl | text-3xl | 30px | Section headings (desktop) |\n| 4xl | text-4xl | 36px | Hero text (mobile) |\n| 5xl | text-5xl | 48px | Hero text (tablet) |\n| 6xl | text-6xl | 60px | Hero text (desktop) |\n\n### Font Weights\n\n| Weight | Tailwind | Use |\n|--------|----------|-----|\n| 400 | font-normal | Body text, descriptions |\n| 500 | font-medium | Emphasized body, buttons, labels |\n| 600 | font-semibold | Headings, titles |\n| 700 | font-bold | Hero headlines, CTAs |\n\n### Typography Patterns\n\n**Hero Headline:**\n```tsx\n<h1 className=\"text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white\">\n```\n\n**Hero Subheadline (muted):**\n```tsx\n<p className=\"text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n```\n\n**Section Label:**\n```tsx\n<span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n```\n\n**Section Title:**\n```tsx\n<h2 className=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black dark:text-white\">\n```\n\n**Body Text:**\n```tsx\n<p className=\"text-base text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n```\n\n**Monospace Label:**\n```tsx\n<span className=\"font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n```\n\n### Line Heights & Letter Spacing\n\n| Context | Line Height | Letter Spacing |\n|---------|-------------|----------------|\n| Headlines | leading-tight (1.2) | tracking-tight (-0.01em) |\n| Body text | leading-relaxed (1.4) | tracking-normal (0) |\n| Labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-wider (0.05em) |\n| Uppercase labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-widest (0.1em) |\n\n---\n\n## Spacing & Layout\n\n### Base Unit: 8px Grid\n\nAll spacing snaps to an 8px grid.\n\n| Unit | Pixels | Tailwind | Use |\n|------|--------|----------|-----|\n| 0.5 | 2px | 0.5 | Micro adjustments |\n| 1 | 4px | 1 | Tight inline gaps |\n| 2 | 8px | 2 | Standard padding, icon gaps |\n| 3 | 12px | 3 | Small component gaps |\n| 4 | 16px | 4 | Component padding, margins |\n| 6 | 24px | 6 | Section inner padding |\n| 8 | 32px | 8 | Component margins |\n| 12 | 48px | 12 | Section gaps |\n| 16 | 64px | 16 | Large section padding |\n| 24 | 96px | 24 | Hero spacing |\n\n### Container\n\n```tsx\n<div className=\"mx-auto w-full max-w-5xl px-6 md:px-12\">\n  {children}\n</div>\n```\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Maximum width | 1024px (max-w-5xl) |\n| Horizontal padding (mobile) | 24px (px-6) |\n| Horizontal padding (desktop) | 48px (md:px-12) |\n\n### Section Padding\n\n| Pattern | Class | Use |\n|---------|-------|-----|\n| **Hero** | `pt-28 pb-16 sm:pt-32 sm:pb-24 md:pt-40 md:pb-32` | First section with nav offset |\n| **Standard** | `py-16 md:py-24` | Most content sections |\n| **Compact** | `py-12 md:py-16` | Secondary sections |\n| **Footer** | `py-8` | Footer content |\n\n### Responsive Breakpoints\n\n| Breakpoint | Width | Prefix |\n|------------|-------|--------|\n| Mobile | < 640px | (default) |\n| Small | ≥ 640px | sm: |\n| Medium | ≥ 768px | md: |\n| Large | ≥ 1024px | lg: |\n| XL | ≥ 1280px | xl: |\n\n---\n\n## Shadow System\n\n### Philosophy\n\nShadows in Entourage are **minimal and purposeful**. The blueprint aesthetic favors flat design, but subtle shadows can indicate elevation when needed.\n\n### Shadow Tokens\n\n```css\n/* Light mode shadows */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n\n/* Dark mode shadows (deeper, less visible) */\n--shadow-card-dark: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n--shadow-card-hover-dark: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n--shadow-lg-dark: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\n### Shadow Usage\n\n| Element | Shadow | Use Case |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Buttons** | none | Flat by default (use borders) |\n| **Cards at rest** | shadow-sm or none | Minimal elevation |\n| **Cards on hover** | shadow-card-hover | Subtle lift effect |\n| **Dropdowns** | shadow-lg | Floating above content |\n| **Modals** | shadow-xl | Highest elevation |\n| **Toasts** | shadow-lg | Notification prominence |\n\n### When to Use Shadows\n\n**Use shadows for:**\n- Floating elements (dropdowns, popovers, modals)\n- Interactive card hover states\n- Toast notifications\n\n**Avoid shadows on:**\n- Static cards (prefer borders)\n- Buttons (use border states)\n- Navigation elements\n- Within the main content flow\n\n---\n\n## Plus Corner System\n\n### Concept\n\nThe Plus Corner is Entourage's **signature decorative element** — four plus signs (+) that mark the corners of featured containers. This is derived from technical blueprints where plus marks indicate measurement points.\n\n```\n   +───────────────────────────+\n   ╎                           ╎\n   ╎     Content Area          ╎\n   ╎                           ╎\n   +───────────────────────────+\n```\n\n### Plus Corner Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Specifications\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Size | 20px × 20px (w-5 h-5) |\n| Position offset | 10px from corner (-top-2.5 -left-2.5) |\n| Stroke width | 1px |\n| Color (light) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Color (dark) | zinc-600 (#52525B) |\n\n### Opacity Tiers\n\nThree-tier system for consistent application:\n\n| Tier | Opacity | Use Case |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| **Subtle** | 50% (opacity-50) | Background decoration, static frames |\n| **Default** | 100% | Standard cards, featured sections |\n| **Emphasis** | 100% + scale | Hover states with slight grow effect |\n\n### Animation (Staggered Reveal)\n\nFor enhanced interactivity, Plus Corners can animate in with a stagger effect:\n\n```css\n.plus-corner {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.8);\n  transition:\n    opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1),\n    transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n}\n\n/* Stagger delays */\n.plus-corner--tl { transition-delay: 0ms; }\n.plus-corner--tr { transition-delay: 50ms; }\n.plus-corner--bl { transition-delay: 100ms; }\n.plus-corner--br { transition-delay: 150ms; }\n\n/* Visible state */\n.group:hover .plus-corner {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1);\n}\n\n/* Reduced motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .plus-corner {\n    transition: opacity 0ms;\n    transform: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Hover Enhancement (Optional)\n\nFor interactive cards, Plus Corners can subtly shift color on hover:\n\n```tsx\n<PlusCorner\n  className={cn(\n    \"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5\",\n    \"text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    \"transition-colors duration-150\",\n    \"group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\n### Full Implementation\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function PlusCornerCard({\n  children,\n  className,\n  dashed = true,\n  interactive = false\n}: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  const cornerClass = cn(\n    \"absolute w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        \"group relative\",\n        dashed\n          ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n          : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n        \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### SVG Implementation (Embedded Graphics)\n\nWhen Plus Corners appear inside an SVG:\n\n```svg\n<g class=\"stroke-zinc-400 dark:stroke-zinc-600\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\">\n  <!-- Plus at position (x, y) with 5px arms -->\n  <path d=\"M x y-5 v 10 M x-5 y h 10\" />\n</g>\n```\n\n### Exclusion List (When NOT to Use)\n\nDo **not** apply Plus Corners to:\n\n| Element | Reason |\n|---------|--------|\n| Body text/paragraphs | Decorative noise |\n| Icons | Too small, cluttered |\n| Inline links | Disrupts reading flow |\n| Buttons | Use border states instead |\n| Navigation items | Use underline/color |\n| Toast notifications | Keep minimal |\n| Tooltips | Too small |\n| Very small components (< 80px) | Corners overwhelm content |\n| Footer | Keep simple |\n| Form inputs | Use focus states |\n\n### Application Contexts\n\n| Element | Plus Corners | Style |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **Hero section** | Yes | Dashed border + corners |\n| **Feature cards** | Yes | Dashed or solid |\n| **Bento grid items** | Yes | Default opacity |\n| **Images/media frames** | Yes, subtle | 50% opacity |\n| **Section dividers** | Optional | At endpoints only |\n| **Buttons** | No | — |\n| **Inputs** | No | — |\n\n---\n\n## Borders & Dividers\n\n### Border Styles\n\n| Type | Class | Use |\n|------|-------|-----|\n| **Solid** | `border` | Cards, buttons, primary containers |\n| **Dashed** | `border-dashed` | Featured frames, hero sections |\n| **Dotted** | `border-dotted` or SVG | Embedded graphics, construction guides |\n\n### Border Colors\n\n| Context | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| **Primary borders** | border-black | border-white |\n| **Card borders** | border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 |\n| **Dashed frames** | border-zinc-200 or border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 or border-zinc-800 |\n| **Subtle dividers** | border-zinc-200 | border-zinc-800 |\n\n### Border Width\n\n| Width | Class | Use |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| 1px | border | Standard borders |\n| 2px | border-2 | Emphasis, focus states |\n\n---\n\n## Components (ShadcnUI Patterns)\n\n### Component Wrapper Philosophy\n\n**Never edit ShadcnUI components directly.** Create wrapper components that apply brand styling.\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadcnUI primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx

Iconify\n\nWe use Iconify for access to 200,000+ open source icons.\n\n#### Recommended Sets\n\n| Set | Prefix | Use Case |\n|-----|--------|----------|\n| **Lucide** | lucide: | Primary UI icons |\n| **Simple Icons** | simple-icons: | Brand/product logos |\n| **MDI** | mdi: | Additional coverage |\n| **Line-MD** | line-md: | Animated icons |\n\n#### Icon Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Icon.tsx\nimport { Icon as IconifyIcon } from \"@iconify-icon/react\";\n\ninterface IconProps {\n  icon: string;\n  size?: number;\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nexport function Icon({

Sizes\n\n| Context | Size | Example |\n|---------|------|---------|\n| Inline with text | 16-18px | Menu items |\n| Card icons | 20-24px | Feature cards |\n| Featured icons | 24-32px | Hero elements |\n| Logo size | 32-48px | Header |\n\n#### Icon Colors\n\nIcons inherit text color:\n- `text-black dark:text-white` — Primary icons\n- `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` — Muted icons\n- Status colors for semantic icons\n\n---\n\n## Animation & Motion\n\n### Philosophy\n\nAnimations should **inform**, not entertain.

The system features a distinctive **Plus Corner** motif as its signature brand element.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Objectivity** | Information over emotion. Let the data speak. |\n| **Precision** | Grid-based layouts, consistent spacing, sharp corners. |\n| **Clarity** | High contrast, readable typography, functional color. |\n| **Density** | Information-rich interfaces that respect the user's time. |\n| **Intentionality** | Every element has purpose. Brand elements (Plus Corners) create consistency; UI elements enable action. |\n\n### Design Inspiration\n\n| Source | What We Borrow |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Engineering drawings** | Sharp corners, measurement markers, construction guides |\n| **Vercel** | Technical precision, developer focus |\n| **Linear** | Dense information display, keyboard-first, monospace accents |\n\n### The Technical Blueprint Aesthetic\n\nThink of Entourage's interface as a technical drawing:\n- Sharp corners (0px radius everywhere)\n- Dashed/dotted borders as construction guides\n- Plus signs (+) as signature corner markers\n- Monospace text for data and labels\n- High contrast black/white with a vibrant accent palette\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n| Category | Technology |\n|----------|------------|\n| Framework | Next.js 16, React 19 |\n| Components | ShadcnUI (base) → Custom wrappers |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |\n| Animation | Framer Motion |\n| Icons | Iconify (Lucide primary, Simple Icons for brands) |\n| Fonts | Switzer (UI), Geist Mono (code/data) |\n\n---\n\n## Color System\n\n### Design Methodology\n\nColors are **functional signals**, not decoration. We use a strictly monochromatic base with semantic colors for status only.\n\n### Primary Palette: Monochrome\n\n```css\n/* Core — Brand foundation */\n--color-black:       #000000;   /* Primary text, borders (light mode) */\n--color-white:       #FFFFFF;   /* Backgrounds (light mode) */\n```\n\n### Gray Scale (Zinc)\n\n| Token | Hex | Light Mode Use | Dark Mode Use |\n|-------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| **zinc-50** | #FAFAFA | Subtle backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-100** | #F4F4F5 | Section backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-200** | #E4E4E7 | Dashed borders | — |\n| **zinc-300** | #D4D4D8 | Dotted borders, input borders | — |\n| **zinc-400** | #A1A1AA | Plus corners, labels | — |\n| **zinc-500** | #71717A | Muted text | Body text |\n| **zinc-600** | #52525B | — | Plus corners |\n| **zinc-700** | #3F3F46 | — | Dotted borders |\n| **zinc-800** | #27272A | — | Dashed borders |\n| **zinc-900** | #18181B | — | Backgrounds |\n\n### Semantic Colors (Status Only)\n\nColors communicate state, not brand. Use sparingly and always pair with context.\n\n| Status | Hex | RGB | Use |\n|--------|-----|-----|-----|\n| **Green** | #48BB78 | 72, 187, 120 | Success, complete, active |\n| **Purple** | #9F7AEA |

101, 101 | Error, failed, destructive |\n\n### Color Pairing Rules\n\n| Context | Background | Text | Border | Hover BG |\n|---------|------------|------|--------|----------|\n| **Page (light)** | white | black | — | — |\n| **Page (dark)** | black | white | — | — |\n| **Card (light)** | white | black | black or zinc-300 | zinc-50 |\n| **Card (dark)** | black | white | white or zinc-700 | zinc-900 |\n| **Primary Button** | white | black | black | zinc-100 |\n| **Solid Button** | black | white | black | zinc-800 |\n| **Muted Text (light)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Muted Text

decoratively** — Every color must have semantic meaning\n2. **Pair color with context** — A colored element alone isn't enough; add text or icon\n3. **Use tints for backgrounds** — Full color for text/borders, 10% opacity for backgrounds\n4. **Maintain contrast** — All text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)\n\n### CSS Variables (globals.css)\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode */\n  --background: #FFFFFF;\n  --foreground: #171717;\n  --card: #FFFFFF;\n  --card-foreground: #171717;\n  --primary: #171717;\n  --primary-foreground: #FAFAFA;\n  --secondary: #F5F5F5;\n

#737373;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Typography\n\n### Font Stack\n\n```css\n--font-sans: 'Switzer', system-ui, sans-serif;\n--font-mono: 'Geist Mono', 'Monaco', monospace;\n```\n\n### Font Loading\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\nconst switzer = localFont({\n  src: [\n    { path: \"./fonts/Switzer-Variable.woff2\", style: \"normal\" },\n    { path:

|\n| Labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-wider (0.05em) |\n| Uppercase labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-widest (0.1em) |\n\n---\n\n## Spacing & Layout\n\n### Base Unit: 8px Grid\n\nAll spacing snaps to an 8px grid.\n\n| Unit | Pixels | Tailwind | Use |\n|------|--------|----------|-----|\n| 0.5 | 2px | 0.5 | Micro adjustments |\n| 1 | 4px | 1 | Tight inline gaps |\n| 2 | 8px | 2 | Standard padding, icon gaps |\n| 3 | 12px | 3 | Small component gaps |\n| 4 | 16px | 4 | Component padding, margins |\n| 6 | 24px | 6 | Section inner padding |\n| 8 | 32px | 8 | Component margins |\n| 12 | 48px | 12 | Section gaps |\n| 16 | 64px | 16 | Large section padding |\n| 24 | 96px | 24 | Hero spacing |\n\n### Container\n\n```tsx\n<div className=\"mx-auto w-full max-w-5xl px-6 md:px-12\">\n  {children}\n</div>\n```\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Maximum width | 1024px (max-w-5xl) |\n| Horizontal padding (mobile) | 24px (px-6) |\n| Horizontal padding (desktop) | 48px (md:px-12) |\n\n### Section Padding\n\n| Pattern | Class | Use |\n|---------|-------|-----|\n| **Hero** | `pt-28 pb-16 sm:pt-32 sm:pb-24 md:pt-40 md:pb-32` | First section with nav offset |\n| **Standard** | `py-16 md:py-24` | Most content sections |\n| **Compact** | `py-12 md:py-16` | Secondary sections |\n| **Footer** | `py-8` | Footer content |\n\n### Responsive Breakpoints\n\n| Breakpoint | Width | Prefix |\n|------------|-------|--------|\n| Mobile | < 640px | (default) |\n| Small | ≥ 640px | sm: |\n| Medium | ≥ 768px | md: |\n| Large | ≥ 1024px | lg: |\n| XL | ≥ 1280px | xl: |\n\n---\n\n## Shadow System\n\n### Philosophy\n\nShadows in Entourage are **minimal and purposeful**. The blueprint aesthetic favors flat design, but subtle shadows can indicate elevation when needed.\n\n### Shadow Tokens\n\n```css\n/* Light mode shadows */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n\n/* Dark mode shadows (deeper, less visible) */\n--shadow-card-dark: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n--shadow-card-hover-dark: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n--shadow-lg-dark: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\n### Shadow Usage\n\n| Element | Shadow | Use Case |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Buttons** | none | Flat by default (use borders) |\n| **Cards at rest** | shadow-sm or none | Minimal elevation |\n| **Cards on hover** | shadow-card-hover | Subtle lift effect |\n| **Dropdowns** | shadow-lg | Floating above content |\n| **Modals** | shadow-xl | Highest elevation |\n| **Toasts** | shadow-lg | Notification prominence |\n\n### When to Use Shadows\n\n**Use shadows for:**\n- Floating elements (dropdowns, popovers, modals)\n- Interactive card hover states\n- Toast notifications\n\n**Avoid shadows on:**\n- Static cards (prefer borders)\n- Buttons (use border states)\n- Navigation elements\n- Within the main content flow\n\n---\n\n## Plus Corner System\n\n### Concept\n\nThe Plus Corner is Entourage's **signature decorative element** — four plus signs (+) that mark the corners of featured containers. This is derived from technical blueprints where plus marks indicate measurement points.\n\n```\n   +───────────────────────────+\n   ╎                           ╎\n   ╎     Content Area          ╎\n   ╎                           ╎\n   +───────────────────────────+\n```\n\n### Plus Corner Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Specifications\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Size | 20px × 20px (w-5 h-5) |\n| Position offset | 10px from corner (-top-2.5 -left-2.5) |\n| Stroke width | 1px |\n| Color (light) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Color (dark) | zinc-600 (#52525B) |\n\n### Opacity Tiers\n\nThree-tier system for consistent application:\n\n| Tier | Opacity | Use Case |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| **Subtle** | 50% (opacity-50) | Background decoration, static frames |\n| **Default** | 100% | Standard cards, featured sections |\n| **Emphasis** | 100% + scale | Hover states with slight grow effect |\n\n### Animation (Staggered Reveal)\n\nFor enhanced interactivity, Plus Corners can animate in with a stagger effect:\n\n```css\n.plus-corner {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.8);\n  transition:\n    opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1),\n    transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n}\n\n/* Stagger delays */\n.plus-corner--tl { transition-delay: 0ms; }\n.plus-corner--tr { transition-delay: 50ms; }\n.plus-corner--bl { transition-delay: 100ms; }\n.plus-corner--br { transition-delay: 150ms; }\n\n/* Visible state */\n.group:hover .plus-corner {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1);\n}\n\n/* Reduced motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .plus-corner {\n    transition: opacity 0ms;\n    transform: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Hover Enhancement (Optional)\n\nFor interactive cards, Plus Corners can subtly shift color on hover:\n\n```tsx\n<PlusCorner\n  className={cn(\n    \"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5\",\n    \"text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    \"transition-colors duration-150\",\n    \"group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\n### Full Implementation\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function PlusCornerCard({\n  children,\n  className,\n  dashed = true,\n  interactive = false\n}: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  const cornerClass = cn(\n    \"absolute w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        \"group relative\",\n        dashed\n          ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n          : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n        \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### SVG Implementation (Embedded Graphics)\n\nWhen Plus Corners appear inside an SVG:\n\n```svg\n<g class=\"stroke-zinc-400 dark:stroke-zinc-600\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\">\n  <!-- Plus at position (x, y) with 5px arms -->\n  <path d=\"M x y-5 v 10 M x-5 y h 10\" />\n</g>\n```\n\n### Exclusion List (When NOT to Use)\n\nDo **not** apply Plus Corners to:\n\n| Element | Reason |\n|---------|--------|\n| Body text/paragraphs | Decorative noise |\n| Icons | Too small, cluttered |\n| Inline links | Disrupts reading flow |\n| Buttons | Use border states instead |\n| Navigation items | Use underline/color |\n| Toast notifications | Keep minimal |\n| Tooltips | Too small |\n| Very small components (< 80px) | Corners overwhelm content |\n| Footer | Keep simple |\n| Form inputs | Use focus states |\n\n### Application Contexts\n\n| Element | Plus Corners | Style |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **Hero section** | Yes | Dashed border + corners |\n| **Feature cards** | Yes | Dashed or solid |\n| **Bento grid items** | Yes | Default opacity |\n| **Images/media frames** | Yes, subtle | 50% opacity |\n| **Section dividers** | Optional | At endpoints only |\n| **Buttons** | No | — |\n| **Inputs** | No | — |\n\n---\n\n## Borders & Dividers\n\n### Border Styles\n\n| Type | Class | Use |\n|------|-------|-----|\n| **Solid** | `border` | Cards, buttons, primary containers |\n| **Dashed** | `border-dashed` | Featured frames, hero sections |\n| **Dotted** | `border-dotted` or SVG | Embedded graphics, construction guides |\n\n### Border Colors\n\n| Context |

min-w-[44px]\",\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      className={cn(baseStyles, variants[variant], sizes[size], className)}\n      disabled={disabled || loading}\n      {...props}\n    >\n      {loading && <Loader2 className=\"mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin\" />}\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button States:**\n\n| State | Visual |\n|-------|--------|\n| Default | As specified by variant |\n| Hover | Background shifts (zinc-100/zinc-800) |\n| Focus | 2px black ring with offset |\n| Disabled | 50% opacity, not-allowed cursor |\n| Loading | Spinner icon, disabled state |\n\n**Button Usage:**\n\n| Context | Recommended Variant |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| Primary CTA (Join Waitlist) | solid |\n| Header navigation | secondary |\n| Card actions | primary |\n| Inline/tertiary actions | ghost |\n\n### Dialog (Modal)\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Dialog with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Dialog.tsx\nimport {\n  Dialog as ShadcnDialog,\n

<Button variant=\"ghost\">Cancel</Button>\n      </DialogClose>\n      <Button variant=\"solid\">Confirm</Button>\n    </DialogFooter>\n  </DialogContent>\n</Dialog>\n```\n\n### Table\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Table with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Table.tsx\nimport {\n  Table as ShadcnTable,\n  TableBody,\n  TableCell,\n  TableHead,\n  TableHeader,\n  TableRow as ShadcnTableRow,\n} from \"@/components/ui/table\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype TableProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnTable>;\ntype TableRowProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnTableRow>;\n\nexport function Table({ className, ...props }: TableProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white\">\n      <ShadcnTable className={cn(\"rounded-none\", className)} {...props} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function TableRow({ className, ...props }: TableRowProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnTableRow\n

className=\"text-green-600\">Complete</span>\n      </TableCell>\n    </TableRow>\n  </TableBody>\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Toast (Sonner)\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add sonner\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\nimport { Toaster } from \"@/components/ui/sonner\";\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <Toaster\n          position=\"bottom-right\"\n          toastOptions={{\n            className: cn(\n              \"rounded-none\",\n              \"border border-black dark:border-white\",\n              \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n              \"text-black dark:text-white\",\n              \"shadow-lg\"\n            ),\n          }}\n        />\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { toast } from \"sonner\";\n\n// Success\ntoast.success(\"Task completed successfully\");\n\n// Error\ntoast.error(\"Failed to save changes\");\n\n// Custom\ntoast(\"Processing...\", {\n  description: \"This may take a moment\",\n  action: {\n    label: \"Cancel\",\n    onClick: () => console.log(\"Cancelled\"),\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Toast Rules:**\n- Toasts do NOT get Plus Corners (exclusion list)\n- Keep messages concise (< 60 characters)\n- Use semantic variants (success, error, warning)\n- Position: bottom-right (default)\n\n---\n\n## Loading States\n\n### Skeleton\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Skeleton with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Skeleton.tsx\nimport { Skeleton as ShadcnSkeleton } from \"@/components/ui/skeleton\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype SkeletonProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnSkeleton>;\n\nexport function Skeleton({ className, ...props }: SkeletonProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnSkeleton\n      className={cn(\n        \"rounded-none\",\n        \"bg-zinc-200 dark:bg-zinc-800\",\n        className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Skeleton Patterns\n\n**Card Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function CardSkeleton() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 p-6 space-y-4\">\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-40 w-full\" />     {/* Image */}\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-24\" />        {/* Label */}\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-6 w-3/4\" />       {/* Title */}\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-full\" />      {/* Description line 1 */}\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-1/2\" />       {/* Description line 2 */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Table Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function TableSkeleton({ rows = 5 }: { rows?: number }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white\">\n      <div className=\"border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 p-4\">\n        <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-32\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-24\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-20\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      {[...Array(rows)].map((_, i) => (\n        <div key={i} className=\"border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 p-4\">\n          <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n            <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-48\" />\n            <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-20\" />\n            <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-16\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Loader (Spinner)\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Loader.tsx\nimport { Loader2 } from \"lucide-react\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface LoaderProps {\n  size?: \"sm\" | \"md\" | \"lg\";\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nconst sizes = {\n  sm: \"h-4 w-4\",\n  md: \"h-6 w-6\",\n  lg: \"h-8 w-8\",\n};\n\nexport function Loader({ size = \"md\", className }: LoaderProps) {\n  return (\n    <Loader2\n      className={cn(\n        \"animate-spin text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\",\n        sizes[size],\n        className\n      )}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n// Full page loader\nexport function PageLoader() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex items-center justify-center min-h-[400px]\">\n      <Loader size=\"lg\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Next.js Loading Patterns\n\n**Route-level loading (loading.tsx):**\n\n```tsx\n// app/dashboard/loading.tsx\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nexport default function Loading() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-16\">\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6\">\n        {[...Array(6)].map((_, i) => (\n          <CardSkeleton key={i} />\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Component-level with Suspense:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { Suspense } from \"react\";\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nasync function TaskCards() {\n  const tasks = await fetchTasks();\n  return tasks.map(task => <TaskCard key={task.id} task={task} />);\n}\n\nexport default function DashboardPage() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton />}>\n      <TaskCards />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button loading state:**\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/Button\";\n\nexport function SubmitButton() {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async () => {\n    setLoading(true);\n    await submitForm();\n    setLoading(false);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Button loading={loading} onClick={handleSubmit}>\n      {loading ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cards & Containers\n\n### Card Types\n\n| Type | Border | Background | Plus Corners | Use |\n|------|--------|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Primary Card** | border-black | bg-white | No | Main containers |\n| **Featured Frame** | border-dashed border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Hero, highlights |\n| **Bento Card** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Grid layouts |\n| **Input/Badge** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | No | Form elements |\n\n### Card Patterns\n\n**Primary Card:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white bg-white dark:bg-black p-4\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</div>\n```\n\n**Featured Frame with Plus Corners:**\n```tsx\n<PlusCornerCard className=\"p-6 md:p-12\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</PlusCornerCard>\n```\n\n**Icon Container:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex h-12 w-12 items-center justify-center border border-black dark:border-white\">\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:check\" size={24} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Icons\n\n### Icon System: Iconify\n\nWe use Iconify for access to 200,000+ open source icons.\n\n#### Recommended Sets\n\n| Set | Prefix | Use Case |\n|-----|--------|----------|\n| **Lucide** | lucide: | Primary UI icons |\n| **Simple Icons** | simple-icons: | Brand/product logos |\n| **MDI** | mdi: | Additional coverage |\n| **Line-MD** | line-md: | Animated icons |\n\n#### Icon Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Icon.tsx\nimport { Icon as IconifyIcon } from \"@iconify-icon/react\";\n\ninterface IconProps {\n  icon: string;\n  size?: number;\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nexport function Icon({ icon, size = 24, className }: IconProps) {\n  return (\n    <IconifyIcon\n      icon={icon}\n      width={size}\n      height={size}\n      className={className}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Icon Sizes\n\n| Context | Size | Example |\n|---------|------|---------|\n| Inline with text | 16-18px | Menu items |\n| Card icons | 20-24px | Feature cards |\n| Featured icons | 24-32px | Hero elements |\n| Logo size | 32-48px | Header |\n\n#### Icon Colors\n\nIcons inherit text color:\n- `text-black dark:text-white` — Primary icons\n- `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` — Muted icons\n- Status colors for semantic icons\n\n---\n\n## Animation & Motion\n\n### Philosophy\n\nAnimations should **inform**, not entertain.

The system features a distinctive **Plus Corner** motif as its signature brand element.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Objectivity** | Information over emotion. Let the data speak. |\n| **Precision** | Grid-based layouts, consistent spacing, sharp corners. |\n| **Clarity** | High contrast, readable typography, functional color. |\n| **Density** | Information-rich interfaces that respect the user's time. |\n| **Intentionality** | Every element has purpose. Brand elements (Plus Corners) create consistency; UI elements enable action. |\n\n### Design Inspiration\n\n| Source | What We Borrow |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Engineering drawings** | Sharp corners, measurement markers, construction guides |\n| **Vercel** | Technical precision, developer focus |\n| **Linear** | Dense information display, keyboard-first, monospace accents |\n\n### The Technical Blueprint Aesthetic\n\nThink of Entourage's interface as a technical drawing:\n- Sharp corners (0px radius everywhere)\n- Dashed/dotted borders as construction guides\n- Plus signs (+) as signature corner markers\n- Monospace text for data and labels\n- High contrast black/white with a vibrant accent palette\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n| Category | Technology |\n|----------|------------|\n| Framework | Next.js 16, React 19 |\n| Components | ShadcnUI (base) → Custom wrappers |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |\n| Animation | Framer Motion |\n| Icons | Iconify (Lucide primary, Simple Icons for brands) |\n| Fonts | Switzer (UI), Geist Mono (code/data) |\n\n---\n\n## Color System\n\n### Design Methodology\n\nColors are **functional signals**, not decoration. We use a strictly monochromatic base with semantic colors for status only.\n\n### Primary Palette: Monochrome\n\n```css\n/* Core — Brand foundation */\n--color-black:       #000000;   /* Primary text, borders (light mode) */\n--color-white:       #FFFFFF;   /* Backgrounds (light mode) */\n```\n\n### Gray Scale (Zinc)\n\n| Token | Hex | Light Mode Use | Dark Mode Use |\n|-------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| **zinc-50** | #FAFAFA | Subtle backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-100** | #F4F4F5 | Section backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-200** | #E4E4E7 | Dashed borders | — |\n| **zinc-300** | #D4D4D8 | Dotted borders, input borders | — |\n| **zinc-400** | #A1A1AA | Plus corners, labels | — |\n| **zinc-500** | #71717A | Muted text | Body text |\n| **zinc-600** | #52525B | — | Plus corners |\n| **zinc-700** | #3F3F46 | — | Dotted borders |\n| **zinc-800** | #27272A | — | Dashed borders |\n| **zinc-900** | #18181B | — | Backgrounds |\n\n### Accent Palette\n\nEntourage uses a vibrant, distinguishable accent palette for both brand expression and color coding within the service. These colors are carefully chosen to be visually distinct from each other and accessible on both light and dark backgrounds.\n\n| Color | Hex | Tailwind | Primary Use |\n|-------|-----|----------|-------------|\n| **Emerald** | #10B981 | emerald-500 | Primary accent, success, AI actions, active states |\n| **Violet** | #8B5CF6 | violet-500 | Categories, tags, special elements |\n| **Amber** | #F59E0B | amber-500 | Warnings, attention, pending states |\n| **Rose** | #F43F5E | rose-500 | Errors, destructive actions, urgent |\n| **Sky** | #0EA5E9 | sky-500 | Information, links, secondary actions |\n\n### Semantic Mapping\n\nColors serve double duty: brand expression AND functional meaning.\n\n| Semantic | Color | Use Cases |\n|----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Success** | Emerald | Completed tasks, active status, confirmations |\n| **AI/Processing** | Emerald | AI-powered features, processing indicators |\n| **Warning** | Amber | Pending review, attention needed |\n| **Error** | Rose | Failed actions, validation errors |\n| **Info** | Sky | Informational messages, links |\n| **Special** | Violet | Tags, categories, premium features |\n\n### Color Coding Guidelines\n\nWhen using colors for categorization or tagging:\n- Use the full palette for maximum distinction\n- Pair color with text labels for accessibility\n- Maintain consistent meaning across the product\n- Use 10% opacity backgrounds with full-color text/borders\n\n### Color Pairing Rules\n\n| Context | Background | Text | Border | Hover BG |\n|---------|------------|------|--------|----------|\n| **Page (light)** | white | black | — | — |\n| **Page (dark)** | black | white | — | — |\n| **Card (light)** | white | black | black or zinc-300 | zinc-50 |\n| **Card (dark)** | black | white | white or zinc-700 | zinc-900 |\n| **Primary Button** | white | black | black | zinc-100 |\n| **Solid Button** | black | white | black | zinc-800 |\n| **Muted Text (light)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Muted Text (dark)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (dark)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (dark)** | — | zinc-600 | — | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (light)** | — | — | zinc-200 | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (dark)** | — | — | zinc-800 | — |\n\n### Color Application Rules\n\n1. **Never use color decoratively** — Every color must have semantic meaning\n2. **Pair color with context** — A colored element alone isn't enough; add text or icon\n3. **Use tints for backgrounds** — Full color for text/borders, 10% opacity for backgrounds\n4. **Maintain contrast** — All text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)\n\n### CSS Variables (globals.css)\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode */\n  --background: #FFFFFF;\n  --foreground: #171717;\n  --card: #FFFFFF;\n  --card-foreground: #171717;\n  --primary: #171717;\n

xl: |\n\n---\n\n## Shadow System\n\n### Philosophy\n\nShadows in Entourage are **minimal and purposeful**. The blueprint aesthetic favors flat design, but subtle shadows can indicate elevation when needed.\n\n### Shadow Tokens\n\n```css\n/* Light mode shadows */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n\n/* Dark mode shadows (deeper, less visible) */\n--shadow-card-dark: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n--shadow-card-hover-dark: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n--shadow-lg-dark: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\n### Shadow Usage\n\n| Element | Shadow | Use Case |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Buttons** | none | Flat by default (use borders) |\n| **Cards at rest** | shadow-sm or none | Minimal elevation |\n| **Cards on hover** | shadow-card-hover | Subtle lift effect |\n| **Dropdowns** | shadow-lg | Floating above content |\n| **Modals** | shadow-xl | Highest elevation |\n| **Toasts** | shadow-lg | Notification prominence |\n\n### When to Use Shadows\n\n**Use shadows for:**\n- Floating elements (dropdowns, popovers, modals)\n- Interactive card hover states\n- Toast notifications\n\n**Avoid shadows on:**\n- Static cards (prefer borders)\n- Buttons (use border states)\n- Navigation elements\n- Within the main content flow\n\n---\n\n## Plus Corner System\n\n### Concept\n\nThe Plus Corner is Entourage's **signature decorative element** — four plus signs (+) that mark the corners of featured containers. This is derived from technical blueprints where plus marks indicate measurement points.\n\n```\n   +───────────────────────────+\n   ╎                           ╎\n   ╎     Content Area          ╎\n   ╎                           ╎\n   +───────────────────────────+\n```\n\n### Plus Corner Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Specifications\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Size | 20px × 20px (w-5 h-5) |\n| Position offset | 10px from corner (-top-2.5 -left-2.5) |\n| Stroke width | 1px |\n| Color (light) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Color (dark) | zinc-600 (#52525B) |\n\n### Opacity Tiers\n\nThree-tier system for consistent application:\n\n| Tier | Opacity | Use Case |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| **Subtle** | 50% (opacity-50) | Background decoration, static frames |\n| **Default** | 100% | Standard cards, featured sections |\n| **Emphasis** | 100% + scale | Hover states with slight grow effect |\n\n### Animation (Staggered Reveal)\n\nFor enhanced interactivity, Plus Corners can animate in with a stagger effect:\n\n```css\n.plus-corner {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.8);\n  transition:\n    opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1),\n    transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n}\n\n/* Stagger delays */\n.plus-corner--tl { transition-delay: 0ms; }\n.plus-corner--tr { transition-delay: 50ms; }\n.plus-corner--bl { transition-delay: 100ms; }\n.plus-corner--br { transition-delay: 150ms; }\n\n/* Visible state */\n.group:hover .plus-corner {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1);\n}\n\n/* Reduced motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .plus-corner {\n    transition: opacity 0ms;\n    transform: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Hover Enhancement (Optional)\n\nFor interactive cards, Plus Corners can subtly shift color on hover:\n\n```tsx\n<PlusCorner\n  className={cn(\n    \"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5\",\n    \"text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    \"transition-colors duration-150\",\n    \"group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\n### Full Implementation\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function PlusCornerCard({\n  children,\n  className,\n  dashed = true,\n  interactive = false\n}: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  const cornerClass = cn(\n    \"absolute w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        \"group relative\",\n        dashed\n          ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n          : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n        \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### SVG Implementation (Embedded Graphics)\n\nWhen Plus Corners appear inside an SVG:\n\n```svg\n<g class=\"stroke-zinc-400 dark:stroke-zinc-600\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\">\n  <!-- Plus at position (x, y) with 5px arms -->\n  <path d=\"M x y-5 v 10 M x-5 y h 10\" />\n</g>\n```\n\n### Exclusion List (When NOT to Use)\n\nDo **not** apply Plus Corners to:\n\n| Element | Reason |\n|---------|--------|\n| Body text/paragraphs | Decorative noise |\n| Icons | Too small, cluttered |\n| Inline links | Disrupts reading flow |\n| Buttons | Use border states instead |\n| Navigation items | Use underline/color |\n| Toast notifications | Keep minimal |\n| Tooltips | Too small |\n| Very small components (< 80px) | Corners overwhelm content |\n| Footer | Keep simple |\n| Form inputs | Use focus states |\n\n### Application Contexts\n\n| Element | Plus Corners | Style |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **Hero section** | Yes | Dashed border + corners |\n| **Feature cards** | Yes | Dashed or solid |\n| **Bento grid items** | Yes | Default opacity |\n| **Images/media frames** | Yes, subtle | 50% opacity |\n| **Section dividers** | Optional | At endpoints only |\n| **Buttons** | No | — |\n| **Inputs** | No | — |\n\n---\n\n## Borders & Dividers\n\n### Border Styles\n\n| Type | Class | Use |\n|------|-------|-----|\n| **Solid** | `border` | Cards, buttons, primary containers |\n| **Dashed** | `border-dashed` | Featured frames, hero sections |\n| **Dotted** | `border-dotted` or SVG | Embedded graphics, construction guides |\n\n### Border Colors\n\n| Context | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| **Primary borders** | border-black | border-white |\n| **Card borders** | border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 |\n| **Dashed frames** | border-zinc-200 or border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 or border-zinc-800 |\n| **Subtle dividers** | border-zinc-200 | border-zinc-800 |\n\n### Border Width\n\n| Width | Class | Use |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| 1px | border | Standard borders |\n| 2px | border-2 | Emphasis, focus states |\n\n---\n\n## Components (ShadcnUI Patterns)\n\n### Component Wrapper Philosophy\n\n**Never edit ShadcnUI components directly.** Create wrapper components that apply brand styling.\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadcnUI primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx

{loading && <Loader2 className=\"mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin\" />}\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button States:**\n\n| State | Visual |\n|-------|--------|\n| Default | As specified by variant |\n| Hover | Background shifts (zinc-100/zinc-800) |\n| Focus | 2px black ring with offset |\n| Disabled | 50% opacity, not-allowed cursor |\n| Loading | Spinner icon, disabled state |\n\n**Button Usage:**\n\n| Context | Recommended Variant |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| Primary CTA (Join Waitlist) | solid |\n| Header navigation | secondary |\n| Card actions | primary |\n| Inline/tertiary actions | ghost |\n\n### Dialog (Modal)\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Dialog with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Dialog.tsx\nimport {\n  Dialog as ShadcnDialog,\n

<Button variant=\"ghost\">Cancel</Button>\n      </DialogClose>\n      <Button variant=\"solid\">Confirm</Button>\n    </DialogFooter>\n  </DialogContent>\n</Dialog>\n```\n\n### Table\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Table with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Table.tsx\nimport {\n  Table as ShadcnTable,\n  TableBody,\n  TableCell,\n  TableHead,\n  TableHeader,\n  TableRow as

className=\"text-green-600\">Complete</span>\n      </TableCell>\n    </TableRow>\n  </TableBody>\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Toast (Sonner)\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add sonner\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\nimport { Toaster } from \"@/components/ui/sonner\";\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <Toaster\n          position=\"bottom-right\"\n          toastOptions={{\n            className: cn(\n              \"rounded-none\",\n              \"border

changes\");\n\n// Custom\ntoast(\"Processing...\", {\n  description: \"This may take a moment\",\n  action: {\n    label: \"Cancel\",\n    onClick: () => console.log(\"Cancelled\"),\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Toast Rules:**\n- Toasts do NOT get Plus Corners (exclusion list)\n- Keep messages concise (< 60 characters)\n- Use semantic variants (success, error, warning)\n- Position: bottom-right (default)\n\n---\n\n## Loading States\n\n### Skeleton\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Skeleton with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Skeleton.tsx\nimport { Skeleton as ShadcnSkeleton } from \"@/components/ui/skeleton\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype SkeletonProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnSkeleton>;\n\nexport function Skeleton({ className, ...props }: SkeletonProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnSkeleton\n      className={cn(\n        \"rounded-none\",\n        \"bg-zinc-200 dark:bg-zinc-800\",\n        className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Skeleton Patterns\n\n**Card Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function CardSkeleton() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 p-6 space-y-4\">\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-40 w-full\" />     {/* Image */}\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-24\" />        {/* Label */}\n      <Skeleton

*/}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Table Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function TableSkeleton({ rows = 5 }: { rows?: number }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white\">\n      <div className=\"border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 p-4\">\n        <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-32\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-24\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-20\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      {[...Array(rows)].map((_, i) => (\n        <div key={i} className=\"border-b

<Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-16\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Loader (Spinner)\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Loader.tsx\nimport { Loader2 } from \"lucide-react\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface LoaderProps {\n  size?: \"sm\" | \"md\" | \"lg\";\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nconst sizes = {\n  sm: \"h-4 w-4\",\n  md: \"h-6

justify-center min-h-[400px]\">\n      <Loader size=\"lg\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Next.js Loading Patterns\n\n**Route-level loading (loading.tsx):**\n\n```tsx\n// app/dashboard/loading.tsx\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nexport default function Loading() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-16\">\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6\">\n        {[...Array(6)].map((_, i) => (\n          <CardSkeleton key={i} />\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Component-level with Suspense:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { Suspense } from \"react\";\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nasync function TaskCards() {\n  const tasks = await fetchTasks();\n  return tasks.map(task => <TaskCard key={task.id} task={task} />);\n}\n\nexport default function DashboardPage() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton />}>\n      <TaskCards />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button loading state:**\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/Button\";\n\nexport function SubmitButton() {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async () => {\n    setLoading(true);\n    await submitForm();\n    setLoading(false);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Button loading={loading} onClick={handleSubmit}>\n      {loading ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cards & Containers\n\n### Card Types\n\n| Type | Border | Background | Plus Corners | Use |\n|------|--------|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Primary Card** | border-black | bg-white | No | Main containers |\n| **Featured Frame** | border-dashed border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Hero, highlights |\n| **Bento Card** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Grid layouts |\n| **Input/Badge** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | No | Form elements |\n\n### Card Patterns\n\n**Primary Card:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white bg-white dark:bg-black p-4\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</div>\n```\n\n**Featured Frame with Plus Corners:**\n```tsx\n<PlusCornerCard className=\"p-6 md:p-12\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</PlusCornerCard>\n```\n\n**Icon Container:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex h-12 w-12 items-center justify-center border border-black dark:border-white\">\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:check\" size={24} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Icons\n\n### Icon System: Iconify\n\nWe use Iconify for access to 200,000+ open source icons.\n\n#### Recommended Sets\n\n| Set | Prefix | Use Case |\n|-----|--------|----------|\n| **Lucide** | lucide: | Primary UI icons |\n| **Simple Icons** | simple-icons: | Brand/product logos |\n| **MDI** | mdi: | Additional coverage |\n| **Line-MD** | line-md: | Animated icons |\n\n#### Icon Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Icon.tsx\nimport { Icon as IconifyIcon } from \"@iconify-icon/react\";\n\ninterface IconProps {\n  icon: string;\n  size?: number;\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nexport function Icon({ icon, size = 24, className }: IconProps) {\n  return (\n    <IconifyIcon\n      icon={icon}\n      width={size}\n      height={size}\n      className={className}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Icon Sizes\n\n| Context | Size | Example |\n|---------|------|---------|\n| Inline with text | 16-18px | Menu items |\n| Card icons | 20-24px | Feature cards |\n| Featured icons | 24-32px | Hero elements |\n| Logo size | 32-48px | Header |\n\n#### Icon Colors\n\nIcons inherit text color:\n- `text-black dark:text-white` — Primary icons\n- `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` — Muted icons\n- Status colors for semantic icons\n\n---\n\n## Animation & Motion\n\n### Philosophy\n\nAnimations should **inform**, not entertain.

The system features a distinctive **Plus Corner** motif as its signature brand element.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Objectivity** | Information over emotion. Let the data speak. |\n| **Precision** | Grid-based layouts, consistent spacing, sharp corners. |\n| **Clarity** | High contrast, readable typography, functional color. |\n| **Density** | Information-rich interfaces that respect the user's time. |\n| **Intentionality** | Every element has purpose. Brand elements (Plus Corners) create consistency; UI elements enable action. |\n\n### Design Inspiration\n\n| Source | What We Borrow |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Engineering drawings** | Sharp corners, measurement markers, construction guides |\n| **Vercel** | Technical precision, developer focus |\n| **Linear** | Dense information display, keyboard-first, monospace accents |\n\n### The Technical Blueprint Aesthetic\n\nThink of Entourage's interface as a technical drawing:\n- Sharp corners (0px radius everywhere)\n- Dashed/dotted borders as construction guides\n- Plus signs (+) as signature corner markers\n- Monospace text for data and labels\n- High contrast black/white with a vibrant accent palette\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n| Category | Technology |\n|----------|------------|\n| Framework | Next.js 16, React 19 |\n| Components | ShadcnUI (base) → Custom wrappers |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |\n| Animation | Framer Motion |\n| Icons | Iconify (Lucide primary, Simple Icons for brands) |\n| Fonts | Switzer (UI), Geist Mono (code/data) |\n\n---\n\n## Color System\n\n### Design Methodology\n\nColors are **functional signals**, not decoration. We use a strictly monochromatic base with semantic colors for status only.\n\n### Primary Palette: Monochrome\n\n```css\n/* Core — Brand foundation */\n--color-black:       #000000;   /* Primary text, borders (light mode) */\n--color-white:       #FFFFFF;   /* Backgrounds (light mode) */\n```\n\n### Gray Scale (Zinc)\n\n| Token | Hex | Light Mode Use | Dark Mode Use |\n|-------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| **zinc-50** | #FAFAFA | Subtle backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-100** | #F4F4F5 | Section backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-200** | #E4E4E7 | Dashed borders | — |\n| **zinc-300** | #D4D4D8 | Dotted borders, input borders | — |\n| **zinc-400** | #A1A1AA | Plus corners, labels | — |\n| **zinc-500** | #71717A | Muted text | Body text |\n| **zinc-600** | #52525B | — | Plus corners |\n| **zinc-700** | #3F3F46 | — | Dotted borders |\n| **zinc-800** | #27272A | — | Dashed borders |\n| **zinc-900** | #18181B | — | Backgrounds |\n\n### Accent Palette\n\nEntourage uses a vibrant, distinguishable accent palette for both brand expression and color coding within the service. These colors are carefully chosen to be visually distinct from each other and accessible on both light and dark backgrounds.\n\n| Color | Hex | Tailwind | Primary Use |\n|-------|-----|----------|-------------|\n| **Emerald** | #10B981 | emerald-500 | Primary accent, success, AI actions, active states |\n| **Violet** | #8B5CF6 | violet-500 | Categories, tags, special elements |\n| **Amber** | #F59E0B | amber-500 | Warnings, attention, pending states |\n| **Rose** | #F43F5E | rose-500 | Errors, destructive actions, urgent |\n| **Sky** | #0EA5E9 | sky-500 | Information, links, secondary actions |\n\n### Semantic Mapping\n\nColors serve double duty: brand expression AND functional meaning.\n\n| Semantic | Color | Use Cases |\n|----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Success** | Emerald | Completed tasks, active status, confirmations |\n| **AI/Processing** | Emerald | AI-powered features, processing indicators |\n| **Warning** | Amber | Pending review, attention needed |\n| **Error** | Rose | Failed actions, validation errors |\n| **Info** | Sky | Informational messages, links |\n| **Special** | Violet | Tags, categories, premium features |\n\n### Color Coding Guidelines\n\nWhen using colors for categorization or tagging:\n- Use the full palette for maximum distinction\n- Pair color with text labels for accessibility\n- Maintain consistent meaning across the product\n- Use 10% opacity backgrounds with full-color text/borders\n\n### Color Pairing Rules\n\n| Context | Background | Text | Border | Hover BG |\n|---------|------------|------|--------|----------|\n| **Page (light)** | white | black | — | — |\n| **Page (dark)** | black | white | — | — |\n| **Card (light)** | white | black | black or zinc-300 | zinc-50 |\n| **Card (dark)** | black | white | white or zinc-700 | zinc-900 |\n| **Primary Button** | white | black | black | zinc-100 |\n| **Solid Button** | black | white | black | zinc-800 |\n| **Muted Text (light)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Muted Text (dark)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (dark)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (dark)** | — | zinc-600 | — | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (light)** | — | — | zinc-200 | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (dark)** | — | — | zinc-800 | — |\n\n### Color Application Rules\n\n1. **Never use color decoratively** — Every color must have semantic meaning\n2. **Pair color with context** — A colored element alone isn't enough; add text or icon\n3. **Use tints for backgrounds** — Full color for text/borders, 10% opacity for backgrounds\n4. **Maintain contrast** — All text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)\n\n### CSS Variables (globals.css)\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode */\n  --background: #FFFFFF;\n  --foreground: #171717;\n  --card: #FFFFFF;\n  --card-foreground: #171717;\n  --primary: #171717;\n

 subsets: [\"latin\"],\n});\n```\n\n### Type Scale\n\n| Size | Tailwind | Pixels | Use |\n|------|----------|--------|-----|\n| xs | text-xs | 12px | Labels, tags, metadata |\n| sm | text-sm | 14px | Secondary text, descriptions |\n| base | text-base | 16px | Body text, paragraphs |\n| lg | text-lg | 18px | Large body, card titles |\n| xl | text-xl | 20px | Section subtitles |\n| 2xl | text-2xl | 24px | Section headings (mobile) |\n| 3xl | text-3xl | 30px | Section headings (desktop) |\n| 4xl | text-4xl | 36px | Hero text (mobile) |\n| 5xl | text-5xl | 48px | Hero text (tablet) |\n| 6xl | text-6xl | 60px | Hero text (desktop) |\n\n### Font Weights\n\n| Weight | Tailwind | Use |\n|--------|----------|-----|\n| 400 | font-normal | Body text, descriptions |\n| 500 | font-medium | Emphasized body, buttons, labels |\n| 600 | font-semibold | Headings, titles |\n| 700 | font-bold | Hero headlines, CTAs |\n\n### Typography Patterns\n\n**Hero Headline:**\n```tsx\n<h1 className=\"text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white\">\n```\n\n**Hero Subheadline (muted):**\n```tsx\n<p className=\"text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n```\n\n**Section Label:**\n```tsx\n<span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n```\n\n**Section Title:**\n```tsx\n<h2 className=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black dark:text-white\">\n```\n\n**Body Text:**\n```tsx\n<p className=\"text-base text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n```\n\n**Monospace Label:**\n```tsx\n<span className=\"font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n```\n\n### Line Heights & Letter Spacing\n\n| Context | Line Height | Letter Spacing |\n|---------|-------------|----------------|\n| Headlines | leading-tight (1.2) | tracking-tight (-0.01em) |\n| Body text | leading-relaxed (1.4) | tracking-normal (0) |\n| Labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-wider (0.05em) |\n| Uppercase labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-widest (0.1em) |\n\n---\n\n## Spacing & Layout\n\n### Base Unit: 8px Grid\n\nAll spacing snaps to an 8px grid.\n\n| Unit | Pixels | Tailwind | Use |\n|------|--------|----------|-----|\n| 0.5 | 2px | 0.5 | Micro adjustments |\n| 1 | 4px | 1 | Tight inline gaps |\n| 2 | 8px | 2 | Standard padding, icon gaps |\n| 3 | 12px | 3 | Small component gaps |\n| 4 | 16px | 4 | Component padding, margins |\n| 6 | 24px | 6 | Section inner padding |\n| 8 | 32px | 8 | Component margins |\n| 12 | 48px | 12 | Section gaps |\n| 16 | 64px | 16 | Large section padding |\n| 24 | 96px | 24 | Hero spacing |\n\n### Container\n\n```tsx\n<div className=\"mx-auto w-full max-w-5xl px-6 md:px-12\">\n  {children}\n</div>\n```\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Maximum width | 1024px (max-w-5xl) |\n| Horizontal padding (mobile) | 24px (px-6) |\n| Horizontal padding (desktop) | 48px (md:px-12) |\n\n### Section Padding\n\n| Pattern | Class | Use |\n|---------|-------|-----|\n| **Hero** | `pt-28 pb-16 sm:pt-32 sm:pb-24 md:pt-40 md:pb-32` | First section with nav offset |\n| **Standard** | `py-16 md:py-24` | Most content sections |\n| **Compact** | `py-12 md:py-16` | Secondary sections |\n| **Footer** | `py-8` | Footer content |\n\n### Responsive Breakpoints\n\n| Breakpoint | Width | Prefix |\n|------------|-------|--------|\n| Mobile | < 640px | (default) |\n| Small | ≥ 640px | sm: |\n| Medium | ≥ 768px | md: |\n| Large | ≥ 1024px | lg: |\n| XL | ≥ 1280px | xl: |\n\n---\n\n## Shadow System\n\n### Philosophy\n\nShadows in Entourage are **minimal and purposeful**. The blueprint aesthetic favors flat design, but subtle shadows can indicate elevation when needed.\n\n### Shadow Tokens\n\n```css\n/* Light mode shadows */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n\n/* Dark mode shadows (deeper, less visible) */\n--shadow-card-dark: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n--shadow-card-hover-dark: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n--shadow-lg-dark: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\n### Shadow Usage\n\n| Element | Shadow | Use Case |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Buttons** | none | Flat by default (use borders) |\n| **Cards at rest** | shadow-sm or none | Minimal elevation |\n| **Cards on hover** | shadow-card-hover | Subtle lift effect |\n| **Dropdowns** | shadow-lg | Floating above content |\n| **Modals** | shadow-xl | Highest elevation |\n| **Toasts** | shadow-lg | Notification prominence |\n\n### When to Use Shadows\n\n**Use shadows for:**\n- Floating elements (dropdowns, popovers, modals)\n- Interactive card hover states\n- Toast notifications\n\n**Avoid shadows on:**\n- Static cards (prefer borders)\n- Buttons (use border states)\n- Navigation elements\n- Within the main content flow\n\n---\n\n## Plus Corner System\n\n### Concept\n\nThe Plus Corner is Entourage's **signature decorative element** — four plus signs (+) that mark the corners of featured containers. This is derived from technical blueprints where plus marks indicate measurement points.\n\n```\n   +───────────────────────────+\n   ╎                           ╎\n   ╎     Content Area          ╎\n   ╎                           ╎\n   +───────────────────────────+\n```\n\n### Plus Corner Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Specifications\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Size | 20px × 20px (w-5 h-5) |\n| Position offset | 10px from corner (-top-2.5 -left-2.5) |\n| Stroke width | 1px |\n| Color (light) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Color (dark) | zinc-600 (#52525B) |\n\n### Opacity Tiers\n\nThree-tier system for consistent application:\n\n| Tier | Opacity | Use Case |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| **Subtle** | 50% (opacity-50) | Background decoration, static frames |\n| **Default** | 100% | Standard cards, featured sections |\n| **Emphasis** | 100% + scale | Hover states with slight grow effect |\n\n### Animation (Staggered Reveal)\n\nFor enhanced interactivity, Plus Corners can animate in with a stagger effect:\n\n```css\n.plus-corner {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.8);\n  transition:\n    opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1),\n    transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n}\n\n/* Stagger delays */\n.plus-corner--tl { transition-delay: 0ms; }\n.plus-corner--tr { transition-delay: 50ms; }\n.plus-corner--bl { transition-delay: 100ms; }\n.plus-corner--br { transition-delay: 150ms; }\n\n/* Visible state */\n.group:hover .plus-corner {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1);\n}\n\n/* Reduced motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .plus-corner {\n    transition: opacity 0ms;\n    transform: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Hover Enhancement (Optional)\n\nFor interactive cards, Plus Corners can subtly shift color on hover:\n\n```tsx\n<PlusCorner\n  className={cn(\n    \"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5\",\n    \"text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    \"transition-colors duration-150\",\n    \"group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\n### Full Implementation\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function PlusCornerCard({\n  children,\n  className,\n  dashed = true,\n  interactive = false\n}: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  const cornerClass = cn(\n    \"absolute w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        \"group relative\",\n        dashed\n          ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n          : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n        \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### SVG Implementation (Embedded Graphics)\n\nWhen Plus Corners appear inside an SVG:\n\n```svg\n<g class=\"stroke-zinc-400 dark:stroke-zinc-600\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\">\n  <!-- Plus at position (x, y) with 5px arms -->\n  <path d=\"M x y-5 v 10 M x-5 y h 10\" />\n</g>\n```\n\n### Exclusion List (When NOT to Use)\n\nDo **not** apply Plus Corners to:\n\n| Element | Reason |\n|---------|--------|\n| Body text/paragraphs | Decorative noise |\n| Icons | Too small, cluttered |\n| Inline links | Disrupts reading flow |\n| Buttons | Use border states instead |\n| Navigation items | Use underline/color |\n| Toast notifications | Keep minimal |\n| Tooltips | Too small |\n| Very small components (< 80px) | Corners overwhelm content |\n| Footer | Keep simple |\n| Form inputs | Use focus states |\n\n### Application Contexts\n\n| Element | Plus Corners | Style |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **Hero section** | Yes | Dashed border + corners |\n| **Feature cards** | Yes | Dashed or solid |\n| **Bento grid items** | Yes | Default opacity |\n| **Images/media frames** | Yes, subtle | 50% opacity |\n| **Section dividers** | Optional | At endpoints only |\n| **Buttons** | No | — |\n| **Inputs** | No | — |\n\n---\n\n## Borders & Dividers\n\n### Border Styles\n\n| Type | Class | Use |\n|------|-------|-----|\n| **Solid** | `border` | Cards, buttons, primary containers |\n| **Dashed** | `border-dashed` | Featured frames, hero sections |\n| **Dotted** | `border-dotted` or SVG | Embedded graphics, construction guides |\n\n### Border Colors\n\n| Context | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| **Primary borders** | border-black | border-white |\n| **Card borders** | border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 |\n| **Dashed frames** | border-zinc-200 or border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 or border-zinc-800 |\n| **Subtle dividers** | border-zinc-200 | border-zinc-800 |\n\n### Border Width\n\n| Width | Class | Use |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| 1px | border | Standard borders |\n| 2px | border-2 | Emphasis, focus states |\n\n---\n\n## Components (ShadcnUI Patterns)\n\n### Component Wrapper Philosophy\n\n**Never edit ShadcnUI components directly.** Create wrapper components that apply brand styling.\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadcnUI primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx         # Raw ShadcnUI\n│   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   └── ...\n├── Button.tsx             # Entourage wrapper (CUSTOMIZE HERE)\n├── Dialog.tsx             # Entourage wrapper\n└── ...\n```\n\n### Button\n\n**Base:** Custom implementation following Entourage brand.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/Button.tsx\nimport { ButtonHTMLAttributes, ReactNode } from \"react\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport { Loader2 } from \"lucide-react\";\n\ninterface ButtonProps extends ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {\n  children: ReactNode;\n  variant?: \"primary\" | \"solid\" |

min-w-[44px]\",\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      className={cn(baseStyles, variants[variant], sizes[size], className)}\n      disabled={disabled || loading}\n      {...props}\n    >\n      {loading && <Loader2 className=\"mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin\" />}\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button States:**\n\n| State | Visual |\n|-------|--------|\n| Default | As specified by variant |\n| Hover | Background shifts (zinc-100/zinc-800) |\n| Focus | 2px black ring with offset |\n| Disabled | 50% opacity, not-allowed cursor |\n| Loading | Spinner icon, disabled state |\n\n**Button Usage:**\n\n| Context | Recommended Variant |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| Primary CTA (Join Waitlist) | solid |\n| Header navigation | secondary |\n| Card actions | primary |\n| Inline/tertiary actions | ghost |\n\n### Dialog (Modal)\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Dialog with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Dialog.tsx\nimport {\n  Dialog as ShadcnDialog,\n  DialogContent as ShadcnDialogContent,\n  DialogDescription,\n  DialogHeader,\n  DialogTitle,\n  DialogTrigger,\n  DialogFooter,\n  DialogClose,\n} from \"@/components/ui/dialog\";\nimport { cn } from

className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Skeleton Patterns\n\n**Card Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function CardSkeleton() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 p-6 space-y-4\">\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-40 w-full\" />     {/* Image */}\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-24\" />        {/* Label */}\n      <Skeleton

*/}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Table Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function TableSkeleton({ rows = 5 }: { rows?: number }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white\">\n      <div className=\"border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 p-4\">\n        <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-32\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-24\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-20\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      {[...Array(rows)].map((_, i) => (\n        <div key={i} className=\"border-b

<Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-16\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Loader (Spinner)\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Loader.tsx\nimport { Loader2 } from \"lucide-react\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface LoaderProps {\n  size?: \"sm\" | \"md\" | \"lg\";\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nconst sizes = {\n  sm: \"h-4 w-4\",\n  md: \"h-6

justify-center min-h-[400px]\">\n      <Loader size=\"lg\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Next.js Loading Patterns\n\n**Route-level loading (loading.tsx):**\n\n```tsx\n// app/dashboard/loading.tsx\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nexport default function Loading() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-16\">\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6\">\n        {[...Array(6)].map((_, i) => (\n          <CardSkeleton key={i} />\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Component-level with Suspense:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { Suspense } from \"react\";\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nasync function TaskCards() {\n  const tasks = await fetchTasks();\n  return tasks.map(task => <TaskCard key={task.id} task={task} />);\n}\n\nexport default function DashboardPage() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton />}>\n      <TaskCards />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button loading state:**\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/Button\";\n\nexport function SubmitButton() {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async () => {\n    setLoading(true);\n    await submitForm();\n    setLoading(false);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Button loading={loading} onClick={handleSubmit}>\n      {loading ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cards & Containers\n\n### Card Types\n\n| Type | Border | Background | Plus Corners | Use |\n|------|--------|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Primary Card** | border-black | bg-white | No | Main containers |\n| **Featured Frame** | border-dashed border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Hero, highlights |\n| **Bento Card** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Grid layouts |\n| **Input/Badge** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | No | Form elements |\n\n### Card Patterns\n\n**Primary Card:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white bg-white dark:bg-black p-4\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</div>\n```\n\n**Featured Frame with Plus Corners:**\n```tsx\n<PlusCornerCard className=\"p-6 md:p-12\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</PlusCornerCard>\n```\n\n**Icon Container:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex h-12 w-12 items-center justify-center border border-black dark:border-white\">\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:check\" size={24} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Icons\n\n### Icon System: Iconify\n\nWe use Iconify for access to 200,000+ open source icons.\n\n#### Recommended Sets\n\n| Set | Prefix | Use Case |\n|-----|--------|----------|\n| **Lucide** | lucide: | Primary UI icons |\n| **Simple Icons** | simple-icons: | Brand/product logos |\n| **MDI** | mdi: | Additional coverage |\n| **Line-MD** | line-md: | Animated icons |\n\n#### Icon Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Icon.tsx\nimport { Icon as IconifyIcon } from \"@iconify-icon/react\";\n\ninterface IconProps {\n  icon: string;\n  size?: number;\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nexport function Icon({ icon, size = 24, className }: IconProps) {\n  return (\n    <IconifyIcon\n      icon={icon}\n      width={size}\n      height={size}\n      className={className}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Icon Sizes\n\n| Context | Size | Example |\n|---------|------|---------|\n| Inline with text | 16-18px | Menu items |\n| Card icons | 20-24px | Feature cards |\n| Featured icons | 24-32px | Hero elements |\n| Logo size | 32-48px | Header |\n\n#### Icon Colors\n\nIcons inherit text color:\n- `text-black dark:text-white` — Primary icons\n- `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` — Muted icons\n- Status colors for semantic icons\n\n---\n\n## Animation & Motion\n\n### Philosophy\n\nEntourage uses two distinct animation categories:\n\n1. **UI Animations** — Fast, functional, inform the user about state changes. These should feel instant and purposeful.\n2. **Ambient Animations** — Slow, atmospheric, create brand presence. These run in the background and establish visual rhythm without demanding attention.\n\nUI animations prioritize clarity. Ambient animations prioritize feel.\n\n### UI Animation Timing\n\n| Interaction | Duration | Easing | Purpose |\n|-------------|----------|--------|---------|\n| Hover state | Instant | — | Immediate feedback |\n| Color transitions | 150ms | ease-out | Smooth visual change |\n| Toggle/switch | 120ms | ease-in-out | Clear state change |\n| Page transition | 150ms | ease-out | Visual continuity |\n| Scroll reveal | 120ms | ease-out | Content appearance |\n| Button press | 100ms | ease-in | Tactile feedback |\n\n### Ambient Animation Timing\n\n| Animation | Duration | Use Case |\n|-----------|----------|----------|\n| Logo pulse | 2-3s | Background brand presence |\n| Circuit signals | 3-5s | Data flow visualization |\n| Infinite scroll | 20-25s | Logo carousels |\n\n### Framer Motion Patterns\n\n**Fade Up Entrance:**\n```tsx\nconst fadeUp = (delay: number) => ({\n  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  animate: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: {\n      duration: 0.15,\n      delay: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : delay,\n      ease: \"easeOut\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Staggered Children:**\n```tsx\nconst container = {\n  hidden: {},\n  visible: {\n    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 },\n  },\n};\n\nconst item = {\n  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  visible: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: { duration: 0.12, ease: \"easeOut\" },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### CSS Animations\n\n```css\n/* Subtle pulse for logos */\n@keyframes pulse-subtle {\n  0%, 100% {\n    opacity: 0.85;\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: scale(1.02);\n  }\n}\n\n.animate-pulse-slow {\n  animation: pulse-subtle 3s ease-in-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Infinite scroll for carousels */\n@keyframes scroll {\n  from { transform: translateX(0); }\n  to { transform: translateX(-50%); }\n}\n\n.animate-scroll {\n  animation: scroll linear infinite;\n}\n```\n\n### Reduced Motion\n\nAlways respect user preferences:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useReducedMotion } from \"framer-motion\";\n\nexport function AnimatedComponent() {\n  const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();\n\n  if (prefersReducedMotion) {\n    return <StaticVersion />;\n  }\n\n  return <AnimatedVersion />;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Dark Mode\n\n### Implementation\n\nDark mode is fully supported using Tailwind's dark variant and CSS custom properties.\n\n### Color Mapping\n\n| Element | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| Background | white (#FFFFFF) | black (#000000) |\n| Foreground text | black (#000000) | white (#FFFFFF) |\n| Muted text | zinc-500 (#71717A) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Label text | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) | zinc-500 (#71717A) |\n| Primary borders | black | white |\n| Dashed borders | zinc-200/zinc-300 | zinc-700/zinc-800 |\n| Plus corners | zinc-400 | zinc-600 |\n| Hover backgrounds | zinc-100 | zinc-800/zinc-900 |\n\n### Pattern\n\nAlways pair light and dark variants:\n\n```tsx\n// Text\nclassName=\"text-black dark:text-white\"\nclassName=\"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\"\n\n// Backgrounds\nclassName=\"bg-white dark:bg-black\"\nclassName=\"hover:bg-zinc-100 dark:hover:bg-zinc-800\"\n\n// Borders\nclassName=\"border-black dark:border-white\"\nclassName=\"border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Standard | Implementation |\n|-------------|----------|----------------|\n| Color contrast | WCAG AA 4.5:1 | Black on white, high contrast palette |\n| Focus indicators | Visible 2px | Ring with offset on all interactives |\n| Keyboard navigation | Logical tab order | Semantic HTML, proper focus management |\n| Screen readers | ARIA labels | Native elements, aria-label where needed |\n| Motion sensitivity | prefers-reduced-motion | useReducedMotion hook |\n\n### Touch Targets\n\nAll interactive elements: minimum **44×44px**.\n\n```tsx\n<button className=\"min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]\">\n```\n\n### Focus States\n\n```tsx\nclassName=\"focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-black focus:ring-offset-2\"\n```\n\n### Screen Reader Considerations\n\n```tsx\n// Icon-only buttons\n<button aria-label=\"Toggle dark mode\">\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:moon\" />\n</button>\n\n// Decorative elements\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" className=\"decorative-element\" />\n```\n\n---\n\n## Voice & Tone\n\n### Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Rational** | Facts over feelings, data over hype |\n| **Technical** | Precise language, no marketing fluff |\n| **Direct** | Say what you mean, no hedging |\n| **Authoritative** | Confident but not arrogant |\n\n### Writing Guidelines\n\n**Headlines:**\n- Active voice, present tense\n- Benefit-focused\n- 3-8 words optimal\n\n```\n✓ \"Know what needs to be done.\"\n✗ \"Our AI-powered platform helps you manage tasks.\"\n```\n\n**Error Messages:**\n- State the problem clearly\n- Provide actionable next steps\n- No cutesy language\n\n```\n✓ \"Failed to parse transcript.

However, having a quick reference for copy-paste patterns IS useful for developers. Let me take a balanced approach:\n- Keep the Quick Reference but make it more focused and add the new accent colors\n- Remove the CSS Variables section since it already exists earlier in the doc\n- Keep the practical patterns (component, typography, spacing)\n\nActually, let me look at whether CSS variables are already defined earlier...Yes, lines 123-160 already have CSS Variables. And the zinc scale is in the Gray Scale table.\n\nI'll simplify the Quick Reference to just be the most-used patterns, and update it to include accent colors. I'll remove the duplicate CSS Variables section.","signature":"EpwKCkYICxgCKkA4lloZ8EmJW0GdMe3/wryC4/fclccPVZzCl35Ux7z2U6ARWD7WHuO2ZIKiF3aYEBTFOvll20Kk+l+Uz/8ULW/UEgy1vCmQNLh4znkwWtIaDClGB+MX8cQNdKHngiIwC94rPQmbw7oxhMFtqshr6spkwyNRsqqbk+zTfhcAwjMVqGG4xourQLTn3vcB3WOmKoMJKIFSkCyBun0Nb28D8ERRIJfKUOmtqbSJ2pxMQgu8xJdfzNlPPo5mkcYDN2hdV4wGEaDZsyE7XGlQAiWfzJoBsi9zkrPWpDaGtaupdQ7J4QgXfXvlvizuqeU1xUxGVUct6XUCFeasOWy+08I2D97XJiGsM3Hz/dHh0lI19cGC/kda4RWUJDYnhWTpWrvwt+KibmHA6dUnLy7B+nsYcMYhnB/xOa7MCMjSQo7cRGik8ENjJ5IwAiOX2Gf/WaUIxFnqYvbsrEmAgLCxyv7AKwZIRtWOWVkKxSO7wFauup2FqyDl42RmVMv1T/UwMOdfv0EwWMR6IBbDv7G1jZaG85h5KXiGw8V04wjUoWv8a8IdqFjIjUVmHE145tn2f0LqWbz8WfVu1fPv2BDC7pNpmTErA5iIAHlKg0N60FtlHRM7ruv4NiMjJJ2gZATXDJqLpR4zGQTRuzcYtriOVrLYER5j9lPNrBk3Kv+UanSCasZlvQhN3oDACbG51Kept6abtkRwK2TTmraJiUagF51ZQrjSmUPxQEANl961xAa+8ZPwDjlKyKf2+DozyKc/T6OkDy09AcNhXvVbdPICsNi95uPgvQildgfKiJcF6D+s5ACXAau/LLnEFhU3s1KrZiYjuhgUVxov2AtmlGA9HE7arMYIzlO5BhCCCa8G2cegGpLNZ0BhHMjXSwAiD3bsTMs3v/4MCCEpMwMQ3jkqdOg8B0GD3tm7KL7PXcnsMAGmFZrNN5FTyvf1Q3/dr9Nx1io59ngcvgAfeXwHSlMKKn+E7fFEAciu1T+M68pasP+Z44HenPyqrtO0PG8aFmuCHCUnobvZfc3cdDYg9R7d6bkB/7V9MtMJMjXVKwiXGrQn+aRbXXnSnBLIZzO9ZEn2w6gqzy5KHfViaslNdoaJeGhDBz20Iam7nJkMwxgKbbDplSzpO/NkzaAVuv7V+6ppAS2zRVM8TLwV1DJ70nGHW+xy8faBFs4V8dRCakVWgIdvhw48hBNPrc6ezKnE37za5cCtUsAozilTFq94y1Uqn7PQPlbd3yvah8laJLWrpSQGrQnVJH27VOtoj+B1/cqm5tLfoQ2P3wlJiXu3+eC7mCLNauaxsK8f14IerD392vZdZZQsIXKA6DKMZyTxItvdrVNRyW0BI6/qToOrjbMmebv0zyOWhJiCUivOzSIMSRsHm6EdAkBGJhY6ZG8diaRkFhltN6ekWYogHDF9fbqod5u94jDRUNq9lReirRl0imKTlVxuTG2F1QSstWXhSkDxZdlZBZGNrk4D1aMu266F6l7fni1wizh4KOfUToM2V6kRqdyVVzznAXm6RmWGitXRmXwI/lGB1JDXRCCQsPmzBBdp/ZPpZtJdexfc0PQuT0AwYhBx08odujOheMgI58CYR/59hDVMaisY7Kbkq3ypT/N/evp4cYhZ25H1xjRi/FFSuW11TCUH2h0UQqNjBnuSo/RrSIdznXKICJlSxOIITTMzcQhnECcFIf+7MXm7cmSEGVLL8mCsApxMle7O+0nBbyCrldZWhLgtGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2056,"cache_read_input_tokens":59535,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2056,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWVGKeYxiFiJkZwv2PyAz","type":"assistant","uuid":"6fd14f39-5478-4c88-806d-9a96e1e4e03f","timestamp":"2025-12-26T12:02:57.888Z"}

2025\n**Foundation:** ShadcnUI + Tailwind CSS v4\n**Audience:** Designers, Developers, AI Agents\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nEntourage's design language is **Technical Blueprint** — an interface aesthetic inspired by engineering drawings, schematics, and precision instruments. The system features a distinctive **Plus Corner** motif as its signature brand element.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Objectivity** | Information over emotion. Let the data speak. |\n| **Precision** | Grid-based layouts, consistent spacing, sharp corners. |\n| **Clarity** | High contrast, readable typography, functional color. |\n| **Density** | Information-rich interfaces that respect the user's time. |\n| **Intentionality** | Every element has purpose. Brand elements (Plus Corners) create consistency; UI elements enable action. |\n\n### Design Inspiration\n\n| Source | What We Borrow |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Engineering drawings** | Sharp corners, measurement markers, construction guides |\n| **Vercel** | Technical precision, developer focus |\n| **Linear** | Dense information display, keyboard-first, monospace accents |\n\n### The Technical Blueprint Aesthetic\n\nThink of Entourage's interface as a technical drawing:\n- Sharp corners (0px radius everywhere)\n- Dashed/dotted borders as construction guides\n- Plus signs (+) as signature corner markers\n- Monospace text for data and labels\n- High contrast black/white with a vibrant accent palette\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n| Category | Technology |\n|----------|------------|\n| Framework | Next.js 16, React 19 |\n| Components | ShadcnUI (base) → Custom wrappers |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |\n| Animation | Framer Motion |\n| Icons | Iconify (Lucide primary, Simple Icons for brands) |\n| Fonts | Switzer (UI), Geist Mono (code/data) |\n\n---\n\n## Color System\n\n### Design Methodology\n\nColors are **functional signals**, not decoration. We use a strictly monochromatic base with semantic colors for status only.\n\n### Primary Palette: Monochrome\n\n```css\n/* Core — Brand foundation */\n--color-black:       #000000;   /* Primary text, borders (light mode) */\n--color-white:       #FFFFFF;   /* Backgrounds (light mode) */\n```\n\n### Gray Scale (Zinc)\n\n| Token | Hex | Light Mode Use | Dark Mode Use |\n|-------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| **zinc-50** | #FAFAFA | Subtle backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-100** | #F4F4F5 | Section backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-200** | #E4E4E7 | Dashed borders | — |\n| **zinc-300** | #D4D4D8 | Dotted borders, input borders | — |\n| **zinc-400** | #A1A1AA | Plus corners, labels | — |\n| **zinc-500** | #71717A | Muted text | Body text |\n| **zinc-600** | #52525B | — | Plus corners |\n| **zinc-700** | #3F3F46 | — | Dotted borders |\n| **zinc-800** | #27272A | — | Dashed borders |\n| **zinc-900** | #18181B | — | Backgrounds |\n\n### Accent Palette\n\nEntourage uses a vibrant, distinguishable accent palette for both brand expression and color coding within the service. These colors are carefully chosen to be visually distinct from each other and accessible on both light and dark backgrounds.\n\n| Color | Hex | Tailwind | Primary Use |\n|-------|-----|----------|-------------|\n| **Emerald** | #10B981 | emerald-500 | Primary accent, success, AI actions, active states |\n| **Violet** | #8B5CF6 | violet-500 | Categories, tags, special elements |\n| **Amber** | #F59E0B | amber-500 | Warnings, attention, pending states |\n| **Rose** | #F43F5E | rose-500 | Errors, destructive actions, urgent |\n| **Sky** | #0EA5E9 | sky-500 | Information, links, secondary actions |\n\n### Semantic Mapping\n\nColors serve double duty: brand expression AND functional meaning.\n\n| Semantic | Color | Use Cases |\n|----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Success** | Emerald | Completed tasks, active status, confirmations |\n| **AI/Processing** | Emerald | AI-powered features, processing indicators |\n| **Warning** | Amber | Pending review, attention needed |\n| **Error** | Rose | Failed actions, validation errors |\n| **Info** | Sky | Informational messages, links |\n| **Special** | Violet | Tags,

accessibility\n- Maintain consistent meaning across the product\n- Use 10% opacity backgrounds with full-color text/borders\n\n### Color Pairing Rules\n\n| Context | Background | Text | Border | Hover BG |\n|---------|------------|------|--------|----------|\n| **Page (light)** | white | black | — | — |\n| **Page (dark)** | black | white | — | — |\n| **Card (light)** | white | black | black or zinc-300 | zinc-50 |\n| **Card (dark)** | black | white | white or zinc-700 | zinc-900 |\n| **Primary Button** | white | black | black | zinc-100 |\n| **Solid Button** | black | white | black | zinc-800 |\n| **Muted Text (light)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Muted Text (dark)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (dark)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (dark)** | — | zinc-600 | — | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (light)** | — | — | zinc-200 | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (dark)** | — | — | zinc-800 | — |\n\n### Color Application Rules\n\n1. **Never use color decoratively** — Every color must have semantic meaning\n2. **Pair color with context** — A colored element alone isn't enough; add text or icon\n3. **Use tints for backgrounds** — Full color for text/borders, 10% opacity for backgrounds\n4. **Maintain contrast** — All text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)\n\n### CSS Variables (globals.css)\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode */\n  --background: #FFFFFF;\n  --foreground: #171717;\n  --card: #FFFFFF;\n  --card-foreground: #171717;\n  --primary: #171717;\n

rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);\n  --ring: #737373;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Typography\n\n### Font Stack\n\n```css\n--font-sans: 'Switzer', system-ui, sans-serif;\n--font-mono: 'Geist Mono', 'Monaco', monospace;\n```\n\n### Font Loading\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\nconst switzer = localFont({\n  src: [\n    { path: \"./fonts/Switzer-Variable.woff2\", style: \"normal\" },\n    { path: \"./fonts/Switzer-VariableItalic.woff2\", style: \"italic\" },\n  ],\n  variable: \"--font-switzer\",\n  display: \"swap\",\n});\n\nconst geistMono = Geist_Mono({\n  variable: \"--font-geist-mono\",\n  subsets: [\"latin\"],\n});\n```\n\n### Type Scale\n\n| Size | Tailwind | Pixels | Use |\n|------|----------|--------|-----|\n| xs | text-xs | 12px | Labels, tags, metadata |\n| sm | text-sm | 14px | Secondary text, descriptions |\n| base | text-base | 16px | Body text, paragraphs |\n| lg | text-lg | 18px | Large body, card titles |\n| xl | text-xl | 20px | Section subtitles |\n| 2xl | text-2xl |

text-6xl | 60px | Hero text (desktop) |\n\n### Font Weights\n\n| Weight | Tailwind | Use |\n|--------|----------|-----|\n| 400 | font-normal | Body text, descriptions |\n| 500 | font-medium | Emphasized body, buttons, labels |\n| 600 | font-semibold | Headings, titles |\n| 700 | font-bold | Hero headlines, CTAs |\n\n### Typography Patterns\n\n**Hero Headline:**\n```tsx\n<h1 className=\"text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white\">\n```\n\n**Hero Subheadline (muted):**\n```tsx\n<p className=\"text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n```\n\n**Section Label:**\n```tsx\n<span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n```\n\n**Section Title:**\n```tsx\n<h2 className=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black dark:text-white\">\n```\n\n**Body Text:**\n```tsx\n<p className=\"text-base text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n```\n\n**Monospace Label:**\n```tsx\n<span className=\"font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n```\n\n### Line Heights & Letter Spacing\n\n| Context | Line Height | Letter Spacing |\n|---------|-------------|----------------|\n| Headlines | leading-tight (1.2) | tracking-tight (-0.01em) |\n| Body text | leading-relaxed (1.4) | tracking-normal (0) |\n| Labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-wider (0.05em) |\n| Uppercase labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-widest (0.1em) |\n\n---\n\n## Spacing & Layout\n\n### Base Unit: 8px Grid\n\nAll spacing snaps to an 8px grid.\n\n| Unit | Pixels | Tailwind | Use |\n|------|--------|----------|-----|\n| 0.5 | 2px | 0.5 | Micro adjustments |\n| 1 | 4px | 1 | Tight inline gaps |\n| 2 | 8px | 2 | Standard padding, icon gaps |\n| 3 | 12px | 3 | Small component gaps |\n| 4 | 16px | 4 | Component padding, margins |\n| 6 | 24px | 6 | Section inner padding |\n| 8 | 32px | 8 | Component margins |\n| 12 | 48px | 12 | Section gaps |\n| 16 | 64px | 16 | Large section padding |\n| 24 | 96px | 24 | Hero spacing |\n\n### Container\n\n```tsx\n<div className=\"mx-auto w-full max-w-5xl px-6 md:px-12\">\n  {children}\n</div>\n```\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Maximum width | 1024px (max-w-5xl) |\n| Horizontal padding (mobile) | 24px (px-6) |\n| Horizontal padding (desktop) | 48px (md:px-12) |\n\n### Section Padding\n\n| Pattern | Class | Use |\n|---------|-------|-----|\n| **Hero** | `pt-28 pb-16 sm:pt-32 sm:pb-24 md:pt-40 md:pb-32` | First section with nav offset |\n| **Standard** | `py-16 md:py-24` | Most content sections |\n| **Compact** | `py-12 md:py-16` | Secondary sections |\n| **Footer** | `py-8` | Footer content |\n\n### Responsive Breakpoints\n\n| Breakpoint | Width | Prefix |\n|------------|-------|--------|\n| Mobile | < 640px | (default) |\n| Small | ≥ 640px | sm: |\n| Medium | ≥ 768px | md: |\n| Large | ≥ 1024px | lg: |\n| XL | ≥ 1280px | xl: |\n\n---\n\n## Shadow System\n\n### Philosophy\n\nShadows in Entourage are **minimal and purposeful**. The blueprint aesthetic favors flat design, but subtle shadows can indicate elevation when needed.\n\n### Shadow Tokens\n\n```css\n/* Light mode shadows */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n\n/* Dark mode shadows (deeper, less visible) */\n--shadow-card-dark: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n--shadow-card-hover-dark: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n--shadow-lg-dark: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\n### Shadow Usage\n\n| Element | Shadow | Use Case |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Buttons** | none | Flat by default (use borders) |\n| **Cards at rest** | shadow-sm or none | Minimal elevation |\n| **Cards on hover** | shadow-card-hover | Subtle lift effect |\n| **Dropdowns** | shadow-lg | Floating above content |\n| **Modals** | shadow-xl | Highest elevation |\n| **Toasts** | shadow-lg | Notification prominence |\n\n### When to Use Shadows\n\n**Use shadows for:**\n- Floating elements (dropdowns, popovers, modals)\n- Interactive card hover states\n- Toast notifications\n\n**Avoid shadows on:**\n- Static cards (prefer borders)\n- Buttons (use border states)\n- Navigation elements\n- Within the main content flow\n\n---\n\n## Plus Corner System\n\n### Concept\n\nThe Plus Corner is Entourage's **signature decorative element** — four plus signs (+) that mark the corners of featured containers. This is derived from technical blueprints where plus marks indicate measurement points.\n\n```\n   +───────────────────────────+\n   ╎                           ╎\n   ╎     Content Area          ╎\n   ╎                           ╎\n   +───────────────────────────+\n```\n\n### Plus Corner Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Specifications\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Size | 20px × 20px (w-5 h-5) |\n| Position offset | 10px from corner (-top-2.5 -left-2.5) |\n| Stroke width | 1px |\n| Color (light) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Color (dark) | zinc-600 (#52525B) |\n\n### Opacity Tiers\n\nThree-tier system for consistent application:\n\n| Tier | Opacity | Use Case |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| **Subtle** | 50% (opacity-50) | Background decoration, static frames |\n| **Default** | 100% | Standard cards, featured sections |\n| **Emphasis** | 100% + scale | Hover states with slight grow effect |\n\n### Animation (Staggered Reveal)\n\nFor enhanced interactivity, Plus Corners can animate in with a stagger effect:\n\n```css\n.plus-corner {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.8);\n  transition:\n    opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1),\n    transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n}\n\n/* Stagger delays */\n.plus-corner--tl { transition-delay: 0ms; }\n.plus-corner--tr { transition-delay: 50ms; }\n.plus-corner--bl { transition-delay: 100ms; }\n.plus-corner--br { transition-delay: 150ms; }\n\n/* Visible state */\n.group:hover .plus-corner {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1);\n}\n\n/* Reduced motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .plus-corner {\n    transition: opacity 0ms;\n    transform: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Hover Enhancement (Optional)\n\nFor interactive cards, Plus Corners can subtly shift color on hover:\n\n```tsx\n<PlusCorner\n  className={cn(\n    \"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5\",\n    \"text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    \"transition-colors duration-150\",\n    \"group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\n### Full Implementation\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function PlusCornerCard({\n  children,\n  className,\n  dashed = true,\n  interactive = false\n}: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  const cornerClass = cn(\n    \"absolute w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        \"group relative\",\n        dashed\n          ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n          : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n        \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### SVG Implementation (Embedded Graphics)\n\nWhen Plus Corners appear inside an SVG:\n\n```svg\n<g class=\"stroke-zinc-400 dark:stroke-zinc-600\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\">\n  <!-- Plus at position (x, y) with 5px arms -->\n  <path d=\"M x y-5 v 10 M x-5 y h 10\" />\n</g>\n```\n\n### Exclusion List (When NOT to Use)\n\nDo **not** apply Plus Corners to:\n\n| Element | Reason |\n|---------|--------|\n| Body text/paragraphs | Decorative noise |\n| Icons | Too small, cluttered |\n| Inline links | Disrupts reading flow |\n| Buttons | Use border states instead |\n| Navigation items | Use underline/color |\n| Toast notifications | Keep minimal |\n| Tooltips | Too small |\n| Very small components (< 80px) | Corners overwhelm content |\n| Footer | Keep simple |\n| Form inputs | Use focus states |\n\n### Application Contexts\n\n| Element | Plus Corners | Style |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **Hero section** | Yes | Dashed border + corners |\n| **Feature cards** | Yes | Dashed or solid |\n| **Bento grid items** | Yes | Default opacity |\n| **Images/media frames** | Yes, subtle | 50% opacity |\n| **Section dividers** | Optional | At endpoints only |\n| **Buttons** | No | — |\n| **Inputs** | No | — |\n\n---\n\n## Borders & Dividers\n\n### Border Styles\n\n| Type | Class | Use |\n|------|-------|-----|\n| **Solid** | `border` | Cards, buttons, primary containers |\n| **Dashed** | `border-dashed` | Featured frames, hero sections |\n| **Dotted** | `border-dotted` or SVG | Embedded graphics, construction guides |\n\n### Border Colors\n\n| Context | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| **Primary borders** | border-black | border-white |\n| **Card borders** | border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 |\n| **Dashed frames** | border-zinc-200 or border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 or border-zinc-800 |\n| **Subtle dividers** | border-zinc-200 | border-zinc-800 |\n\n### Border Width\n\n| Width | Class | Use |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| 1px | border | Standard borders |\n| 2px | border-2 | Emphasis, focus states |\n\n---\n\n## Components (ShadcnUI Patterns)\n\n### Component Wrapper Philosophy\n\n**Never edit ShadcnUI components directly.** Create wrapper components that apply brand styling.\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadcnUI primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx         # Raw ShadcnUI\n│   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   └── ...\n├── Button.tsx             # Entourage wrapper (CUSTOMIZE HERE)\n├── Dialog.tsx             # Entourage wrapper\n└── ...\n```\n\n### Button\n\n**Base:** Custom implementation following Entourage brand.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/Button.tsx\nimport { ButtonHTMLAttributes, ReactNode } from \"react\";\nimport { cn } from

{loading && <Loader2 className=\"mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin\" />}\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button States:**\n\n| State | Visual |\n|-------|--------|\n| Default | As specified by variant |\n| Hover | Background shifts (zinc-100/zinc-800) |\n| Focus | 2px black ring with offset |\n| Disabled | 50% opacity, not-allowed cursor |\n| Loading | Spinner icon, disabled state |\n\n**Button Usage:**\n\n| Context | Recommended Variant |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| Primary CTA (Join Waitlist) | solid |\n| Header navigation | secondary |\n| Card actions | primary |\n| Inline/tertiary actions | ghost |\n\n### Dialog (Modal)\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Dialog with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Dialog.tsx\nimport {\n  Dialog as ShadcnDialog,\n

 </body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { toast } from \"sonner\";\n\n// Success\ntoast.success(\"Task completed successfully\");\n\n// Error\ntoast.error(\"Failed to save changes\");\n\n// Custom\ntoast(\"Processing...\", {\n  description: \"This may take a moment\",\n  action: {\n    label: \"Cancel\",\n    onClick: () => console.log(\"Cancelled\"),\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Toast Rules:**\n- Toasts do NOT get Plus Corners (exclusion list)\n- Keep messages concise (< 60 characters)\n- Use semantic variants (success, error, warning)\n- Position: bottom-right (default)\n\n---\n\n## Loading States\n\n### Skeleton\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Skeleton with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Skeleton.tsx\nimport { Skeleton as ShadcnSkeleton } from \"@/components/ui/skeleton\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype SkeletonProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnSkeleton>;\n\nexport function Skeleton({ className, ...props }: SkeletonProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnSkeleton\n      className={cn(\n        \"rounded-none\",\n        \"bg-zinc-200 dark:bg-zinc-800\",\n        className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Skeleton Patterns\n\n**Card Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function CardSkeleton() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 p-6 space-y-4\">\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-40 w-full\" />     {/* Image */}\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-24\" />        {/* Label */}\n      <Skeleton

*/}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Table Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function TableSkeleton({ rows = 5 }: { rows?: number }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white\">\n      <div className=\"border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 p-4\">\n        <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-32\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-24\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-20\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      {[...Array(rows)].map((_, i) => (\n        <div key={i} className=\"border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 p-4\">\n          <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n            <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-48\" />\n            <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-20\" />\n            <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-16\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Loader (Spinner)\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Loader.tsx\nimport { Loader2 } from \"lucide-react\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface LoaderProps {\n  size?: \"sm\" | \"md\" | \"lg\";\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nconst sizes = {\n  sm: \"h-4 w-4\",\n  md: \"h-6 w-6\",\n  lg: \"h-8 w-8\",\n};\n\nexport function Loader({ size = \"md\", className }: LoaderProps) {\n  return (\n    <Loader2\n      className={cn(\n        \"animate-spin text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\",\n        sizes[size],\n        className\n      )}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n// Full page loader\nexport function PageLoader() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex items-center justify-center min-h-[400px]\">\n      <Loader size=\"lg\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Next.js Loading Patterns\n\n**Route-level loading (loading.tsx):**\n\n```tsx\n// app/dashboard/loading.tsx\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nexport default function Loading() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-16\">\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6\">\n        {[...Array(6)].map((_, i) => (\n          <CardSkeleton key={i} />\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Component-level with Suspense:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { Suspense } from \"react\";\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nasync function TaskCards() {\n  const tasks = await fetchTasks();\n  return tasks.map(task => <TaskCard key={task.id} task={task} />);\n}\n\nexport default function DashboardPage() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton />}>\n      <TaskCards />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button loading state:**\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/Button\";\n\nexport function SubmitButton() {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async () => {\n    setLoading(true);\n    await submitForm();\n    setLoading(false);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Button loading={loading} onClick={handleSubmit}>\n      {loading ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cards & Containers\n\n### Card Types\n\n| Type | Border | Background | Plus Corners | Use |\n|------|--------|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Primary Card** | border-black | bg-white | No | Main containers |\n| **Featured Frame** | border-dashed border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Hero, highlights |\n| **Bento Card** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Grid layouts |\n| **Input/Badge** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | No | Form elements |\n\n### Card Patterns\n\n**Primary Card:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white bg-white dark:bg-black p-4\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</div>\n```\n\n**Featured Frame with Plus Corners:**\n```tsx\n<PlusCornerCard className=\"p-6 md:p-12\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</PlusCornerCard>\n```\n\n**Icon Container:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex h-12 w-12 items-center justify-center border border-black dark:border-white\">\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:check\" size={24} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Icons\n\n### Icon System: Iconify\n\nWe use Iconify for access to 200,000+ open source icons.\n\n#### Recommended Sets\n\n| Set | Prefix | Use Case |\n|-----|--------|----------|\n| **Lucide** | lucide: | Primary UI icons |\n| **Simple Icons** | simple-icons: | Brand/product logos |\n| **MDI** | mdi: | Additional coverage |\n| **Line-MD** | line-md: | Animated icons |\n\n#### Icon Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Icon.tsx\nimport { Icon as IconifyIcon } from \"@iconify-icon/react\";\n\ninterface IconProps {\n  icon: string;\n  size?: number;\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nexport function Icon({ icon, size = 24, className }: IconProps) {\n  return (\n    <IconifyIcon\n      icon={icon}\n      width={size}\n      height={size}\n      className={className}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Icon Sizes\n\n| Context | Size | Example |\n|---------|------|---------|\n| Inline with text | 16-18px | Menu items |\n| Card icons | 20-24px | Feature cards |\n| Featured icons | 24-32px | Hero elements |\n| Logo size | 32-48px | Header |\n\n#### Icon Colors\n\nIcons inherit text color:\n- `text-black dark:text-white` — Primary icons\n- `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` — Muted icons\n- Status colors for semantic icons\n\n---\n\n## Animation & Motion\n\n### Philosophy\n\nEntourage uses two distinct animation categories:\n\n1. **UI Animations** — Fast, functional, inform the user about state changes. These should feel instant and purposeful.\n2. **Ambient Animations** — Slow, atmospheric, create brand presence. These run in the background and establish visual rhythm without demanding attention.\n\nUI animations prioritize clarity. Ambient animations prioritize feel.\n\n### UI Animation Timing\n\n| Interaction | Duration | Easing | Purpose |\n|-------------|----------|--------|---------|\n| Hover state | Instant | — | Immediate feedback |\n| Color transitions | 150ms | ease-out | Smooth visual change |\n| Toggle/switch | 120ms | ease-in-out | Clear state change |\n| Page transition | 150ms | ease-out | Visual continuity |\n| Scroll reveal | 120ms | ease-out | Content appearance |\n| Button press | 100ms | ease-in | Tactile feedback |\n\n### Ambient Animation Timing\n\nAmbient animations create visual interest and brand atmosphere. They should be subtle enough to ignore but present enough to notice.\n\n| Animation | Duration | Use Case |\n|-----------|----------|----------|\n| Logo pulse | 2-3s | Subtle brand presence, hero sections |\n| Circuit signals | 3-5s | Data flow visualization, diagrams |\n| Infinite scroll | 20-25s | Logo carousels, social proof |\n| Plus Corner reveal | 150-200ms | Staggered entrance on card hover |\n\n### Framer Motion Patterns\n\n**Fade Up Entrance:**\n```tsx\nconst fadeUp = (delay: number) => ({\n  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  animate: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: {\n      duration: 0.15,\n      delay: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : delay,\n      ease: \"easeOut\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Staggered Children:**\n```tsx\nconst container = {\n  hidden: {},\n  visible: {\n    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 },\n  },\n};\n\nconst item = {\n  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  visible: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: { duration: 0.12, ease: \"easeOut\" },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### CSS Animations\n\n```css\n/* Subtle pulse for logos */\n@keyframes pulse-subtle {\n  0%, 100% {\n    opacity: 0.85;\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: scale(1.02);\n  }\n}\n\n.animate-pulse-slow {\n  animation: pulse-subtle 3s ease-in-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Infinite scroll for carousels */\n@keyframes scroll {\n  from { transform: translateX(0); }\n  to { transform: translateX(-50%); }\n}\n\n.animate-scroll {\n  animation: scroll linear infinite;\n}\n```\n\n### Reduced Motion\n\nAlways respect user preferences:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useReducedMotion } from \"framer-motion\";\n\nexport function AnimatedComponent() {\n  const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();\n\n  if (prefersReducedMotion) {\n    return <StaticVersion />;\n  }\n\n  return <AnimatedVersion />;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Dark Mode\n\n### Implementation\n\nDark mode is fully supported using Tailwind's dark variant and CSS custom properties.\n\n### Color Mapping\n\n| Element | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| Background | white (#FFFFFF) | black (#000000) |\n| Foreground text | black (#000000) | white (#FFFFFF) |\n| Muted text | zinc-500 (#71717A) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Label text | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) | zinc-500 (#71717A) |\n| Primary borders | black | white |\n| Dashed borders | zinc-200/zinc-300 | zinc-700/zinc-800 |\n| Plus corners | zinc-400 | zinc-600 |\n| Hover backgrounds | zinc-100 | zinc-800/zinc-900 |\n\n### Pattern\n\nAlways pair light and dark variants:\n\n```tsx\n// Text\nclassName=\"text-black dark:text-white\"\nclassName=\"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\"\n\n// Backgrounds\nclassName=\"bg-white dark:bg-black\"\nclassName=\"hover:bg-zinc-100 dark:hover:bg-zinc-800\"\n\n// Borders\nclassName=\"border-black dark:border-white\"\nclassName=\"border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Standard | Implementation |\n|-------------|----------|----------------|\n| Color contrast | WCAG AA 4.5:1 | Black on white, high contrast palette |\n| Focus indicators | Visible 2px | Ring with offset on all interactives |\n| Keyboard navigation | Logical tab order | Semantic HTML, proper focus management |\n| Screen readers | ARIA labels | Native elements, aria-label where needed |\n| Motion sensitivity | prefers-reduced-motion | useReducedMotion hook |\n\n### Touch Targets\n\nAll interactive elements: minimum **44×44px**.\n\n```tsx\n<button className=\"min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]\">\n```\n\n### Focus States\n\n```tsx\nclassName=\"focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-black focus:ring-offset-2\"\n```\n\n### Screen Reader Considerations\n\n```tsx\n// Icon-only buttons\n<button aria-label=\"Toggle dark mode\">\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:moon\" />\n</button>\n\n// Decorative elements\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" className=\"decorative-element\" />\n```\n\n---\n\n## Voice & Tone\n\n### Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Rational** | Facts over feelings, data over hype |\n| **Technical** | Precise language, no marketing fluff |\n| **Direct** | Say what you mean, no hedging |\n| **Authoritative** | Confident but not arrogant |\n\n### Writing Guidelines\n\n**Headlines:**\n- Active voice, present tense\n- Benefit-focused\n- 3-8 words optimal\n\n```\n✓ \"Know what needs to be done.\"\n✗ \"Our AI-powered platform helps you manage tasks.\"\n```\n\n**Error Messages:**\n- State the problem clearly\n- Provide actionable next steps\n- No cutesy language\n\n```\n✓ \"Failed to parse transcript.

The system features a distinctive **Plus Corner** motif as its signature brand element.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Objectivity** | Information over emotion. Let the data speak. |\n| **Precision** | Grid-based layouts, consistent spacing, sharp corners. |\n| **Clarity** | High contrast, readable typography, functional color. |\n| **Density** | Information-rich interfaces that respect the user's time. |\n| **Intentionality** | Every element has purpose. Brand elements (Plus Corners) create consistency; UI elements enable action. |\n\n### Design Inspiration\n\n| Source | What We Borrow |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Engineering drawings** | Sharp corners, measurement markers, construction guides |\n| **Vercel** | Technical precision, developer focus |\n| **Linear** | Dense information display, keyboard-first, monospace accents |\n\n### The Technical Blueprint Aesthetic\n\nThink of Entourage's interface as a technical drawing:\n- Sharp corners (0px radius everywhere)\n- Dashed/dotted borders as construction guides\n- Plus signs (+) as signature corner markers\n- Monospace text for data and labels\n- High contrast black/white with a vibrant accent palette\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n| Category | Technology |\n|----------|------------|\n| Framework | Next.js 16, React 19 |\n| Components | ShadcnUI (base) → Custom wrappers |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |\n| Animation | Framer Motion |\n| Icons | Iconify (Lucide primary, Simple Icons for brands) |\n| Fonts | Switzer (UI), Geist Mono (code/data) |\n\n---\n\n## Color System\n\n### Design Methodology\n\nColors are **functional signals**, not decoration. We use a strictly monochromatic base with semantic colors for status only.\n\n### Primary Palette: Monochrome\n\n```css\n/* Core — Brand foundation */\n--color-black:       #000000;   /* Primary text, borders (light mode) */\n--color-white:       #FFFFFF;   /* Backgrounds (light mode) */\n```\n\n### Gray Scale (Zinc)\n\n| Token | Hex | Light Mode Use | Dark Mode Use |\n|-------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| **zinc-50** | #FAFAFA | Subtle backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-100** | #F4F4F5 | Section backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-200** | #E4E4E7 | Dashed borders | — |\n| **zinc-300** | #D4D4D8 | Dotted borders, input borders | — |\n| **zinc-400** | #A1A1AA | Plus corners, labels | — |\n| **zinc-500** | #71717A | Muted text | Body text |\n| **zinc-600** | #52525B | — | Plus corners |\n| **zinc-700** | #3F3F46 | — | Dotted borders |\n| **zinc-800** | #27272A | — | Dashed borders |\n| **zinc-900** | #18181B | — | Backgrounds |\n\n### Accent Palette\n\nEntourage uses a vibrant, distinguishable accent palette for both brand expression and color coding within the service. These colors are carefully chosen to be visually distinct from each other and accessible on both light and dark backgrounds.\n\n| Color | Hex | Tailwind | Primary Use |\n|-------|-----|----------|-------------|\n| **Emerald** | #10B981 | emerald-500 | Primary accent, success, AI actions, active states |\n| **Violet** | #8B5CF6 | violet-500 | Categories, tags, special elements |\n| **Amber** | #F59E0B | amber-500 | Warnings, attention, pending states |\n| **Rose** | #F43F5E | rose-500 | Errors, destructive actions, urgent |\n| **Sky** | #0EA5E9 | sky-500 | Information, links, secondary actions |\n\n### Semantic Mapping\n\nColors serve double duty: brand expression AND functional meaning.\n\n| Semantic | Color | Use Cases |\n|----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Success** | Emerald | Completed tasks, active status, confirmations |\n| **AI/Processing** | Emerald | AI-powered features, processing indicators |\n| **Warning** | Amber | Pending review, attention needed |\n| **Error** | Rose | Failed actions, validation errors |\n| **Info** | Sky | Informational messages, links |\n| **Special** | Violet | Tags, categories, premium features |\n\n### Color Coding Guidelines\n\nWhen using colors for categorization or tagging:\n- Use the full palette for maximum distinction\n- Pair color with text labels for accessibility\n- Maintain consistent meaning across the product\n- Use 10% opacity backgrounds with full-color text/borders\n\n### Color Pairing Rules\n\n| Context | Background | Text | Border | Hover BG |\n|---------|------------|------|--------|----------|\n| **Page (light)** | white | black | — | — |\n| **Page (dark)** | black | white | — | — |\n| **Card (light)** | white | black | black or zinc-300 | zinc-50 |\n| **Card (dark)** | black | white | white or zinc-700 | zinc-900 |\n| **Primary Button** | white | black | black | zinc-100 |\n| **Solid Button** | black | white | black |

zinc-800 | — |\n\n### Color Application Rules\n\n1. **Never use color decoratively** — Every color must have semantic meaning\n2. **Pair color with context** — A colored element alone isn't enough; add text or icon\n3. **Use tints for backgrounds** — Full color for text/borders, 10% opacity for backgrounds\n4. **Maintain contrast** — All text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)\n\n### CSS

xl: |\n\n---\n\n## Shadow System\n\n### Philosophy\n\nShadows in Entourage are **minimal and purposeful**. The blueprint aesthetic favors flat design, but subtle shadows can indicate elevation when needed.\n\n### Shadow Tokens\n\n```css\n/* Light mode shadows */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n\n/* Dark mode shadows (deeper, less visible) */\n--shadow-card-dark: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n--shadow-card-hover-dark: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n--shadow-lg-dark: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\n### Shadow Usage\n\n| Element | Shadow | Use Case |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Buttons** | none | Flat by default (use borders) |\n| **Cards at rest** | shadow-sm or none | Minimal elevation |\n| **Cards on hover** | shadow-card-hover | Subtle lift effect |\n| **Dropdowns** | shadow-lg | Floating above content |\n| **Modals** | shadow-xl | Highest elevation |\n| **Toasts** | shadow-lg | Notification prominence |\n\n### When to Use Shadows\n\n**Use shadows for:**\n- Floating elements (dropdowns, popovers, modals)\n- Interactive card hover states\n- Toast notifications\n\n**Avoid shadows on:**\n- Static cards (prefer borders)\n- Buttons (use border states)\n- Navigation elements\n- Within the main content flow\n\n---\n\n## Plus Corner System\n\n### Concept\n\nThe Plus Corner is Entourage's **signature decorative element** — four plus signs (+) that mark the corners of featured containers. This is derived from technical blueprints where plus marks indicate measurement points.\n\n```\n   +───────────────────────────+\n   ╎                           ╎\n   ╎     Content Area          ╎\n   ╎                           ╎\n   +───────────────────────────+\n```\n\n### Plus Corner Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Specifications\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Size | 20px × 20px (w-5 h-5) |\n| Position offset | 10px from corner (-top-2.5 -left-2.5) |\n| Stroke width | 1px |\n| Color (light) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Color (dark) | zinc-600 (#52525B) |\n\n### Opacity Tiers\n\nThree-tier system for consistent application:\n\n| Tier | Opacity | Use Case |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| **Subtle** | 50% (opacity-50) | Background decoration, static frames |\n| **Default** | 100% | Standard cards, featured sections |\n| **Emphasis** | 100% + scale | Hover states with slight grow effect |\n\n### Animation (Staggered Reveal)\n\nFor enhanced interactivity, Plus Corners can animate in with a stagger effect:\n\n```css\n.plus-corner {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.8);\n  transition:\n    opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1),\n    transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n}\n\n/* Stagger delays */\n.plus-corner--tl { transition-delay: 0ms; }\n.plus-corner--tr { transition-delay: 50ms; }\n.plus-corner--bl { transition-delay: 100ms; }\n.plus-corner--br { transition-delay: 150ms; }\n\n/* Visible state */\n.group:hover .plus-corner {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1);\n}\n\n/* Reduced motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .plus-corner {\n    transition: opacity 0ms;\n    transform: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Hover Enhancement (Optional)\n\nFor interactive cards, Plus Corners can subtly shift color on hover:\n\n```tsx\n<PlusCorner\n  className={cn(\n    \"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5\",\n    \"text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    \"transition-colors duration-150\",\n    \"group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\n### Full Implementation\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function PlusCornerCard({\n  children,\n  className,\n  dashed = true,\n  interactive = false\n}: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  const cornerClass = cn(\n    \"absolute w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        \"group relative\",\n        dashed\n          ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n          : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n        \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### SVG Implementation (Embedded Graphics)\n\nWhen Plus Corners appear inside an SVG:\n\n```svg\n<g class=\"stroke-zinc-400 dark:stroke-zinc-600\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\">\n  <!-- Plus at position (x, y) with 5px arms -->\n  <path d=\"M x y-5 v 10 M x-5 y h 10\" />\n</g>\n```\n\n### Exclusion List (When NOT to Use)\n\nDo **not** apply Plus Corners to:\n\n| Element | Reason |\n|---------|--------|\n| Body text/paragraphs | Decorative noise |\n| Icons | Too small, cluttered |\n| Inline links | Disrupts reading flow |\n| Buttons | Use border states instead |\n| Navigation items | Use underline/color |\n| Toast notifications | Keep minimal |\n| Tooltips | Too small |\n| Very small components (< 80px) | Corners overwhelm content |\n| Footer | Keep simple |\n| Form inputs | Use focus states |\n\n### Application Contexts\n\n| Element | Plus Corners | Style |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **Hero section** | Yes | Dashed border + corners |\n| **Feature cards** | Yes | Dashed or solid |\n| **Bento grid items** | Yes | Default opacity |\n| **Images/media frames** | Yes, subtle | 50% opacity |\n| **Section dividers** | Optional | At endpoints only |\n| **Buttons** | No | — |\n| **Inputs** | No | — |\n\n---\n\n## Borders & Dividers\n\n### Border Styles\n\n| Type | Class | Use |\n|------|-------|-----|\n| **Solid** | `border` | Cards, buttons, primary containers |\n| **Dashed** | `border-dashed` | Featured frames, hero sections |\n| **Dotted** | `border-dotted` or SVG | Embedded graphics, construction guides |\n\n### Border Colors\n\n| Context | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| **Primary borders** | border-black | border-white |\n| **Card borders** | border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 |\n| **Dashed frames** | border-zinc-200 or border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 or border-zinc-800 |\n| **Subtle dividers** | border-zinc-200 | border-zinc-800 |\n\n### Border Width\n\n| Width | Class | Use |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| 1px | border | Standard borders |\n| 2px | border-2 | Emphasis, focus states |\n\n---\n\n## Components (ShadcnUI Patterns)\n\n### Component Wrapper Philosophy\n\n**Never edit ShadcnUI components directly.** Create wrapper components that apply brand styling.\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadcnUI primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx

{loading && <Loader2 className=\"mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin\" />}\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button States:**\n\n| State | Visual |\n|-------|--------|\n| Default | As specified by variant |\n| Hover | Background shifts (zinc-100/zinc-800) |\n| Focus | 2px black ring with offset |\n| Disabled | 50% opacity, not-allowed cursor |\n| Loading | Spinner icon, disabled state |\n\n**Button Usage:**\n\n| Context | Recommended Variant |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| Primary CTA (Join Waitlist) | solid |\n| Header navigation | secondary |\n| Card actions | primary |\n| Inline/tertiary actions | ghost |\n\n### Dialog (Modal)\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Dialog with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Dialog.tsx\nimport {\n  Dialog as ShadcnDialog,\n

<Button variant=\"ghost\">Cancel</Button>\n      </DialogClose>\n      <Button variant=\"solid\">Confirm</Button>\n    </DialogFooter>\n  </DialogContent>\n</Dialog>\n```\n\n### Table\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Table with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Table.tsx\nimport {\n  Table as ShadcnTable,\n  TableBody,\n  TableCell,\n  TableHead,\n  TableHeader,\n  TableRow as ShadcnTableRow,\n} from \"@/components/ui/table\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype TableProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnTable>;\ntype TableRowProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnTableRow>;\n\nexport function Table({ className, ...props }: TableProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white\">\n

className=\"text-green-600\">Complete</span>\n      </TableCell>\n    </TableRow>\n  </TableBody>\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Toast (Sonner)\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add sonner\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\nimport { Toaster } from \"@/components/ui/sonner\";\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <Toaster\n          position=\"bottom-right\"\n          toastOptions={{\n            className: cn(\n              \"rounded-none\",\n              \"border

 </body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { toast } from \"sonner\";\n\n// Success\ntoast.success(\"Task completed successfully\");\n\n// Error\ntoast.error(\"Failed to save changes\");\n\n// Custom\ntoast(\"Processing...\", {\n  description: \"This may take a moment\",\n  action: {\n    label: \"Cancel\",\n    onClick: () => console.log(\"Cancelled\"),\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Toast Rules:**\n- Toasts do NOT get Plus Corners (exclusion list)\n- Keep messages concise (< 60 characters)\n- Use semantic variants (success, error, warning)\n- Position: bottom-right (default)\n\n---\n\n## Loading States\n\n### Skeleton\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Skeleton with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Skeleton.tsx\nimport { Skeleton as ShadcnSkeleton } from \"@/components/ui/skeleton\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype SkeletonProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnSkeleton>;\n\nexport

dark:border-white\">\n      <div className=\"border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 p-4\">\n        <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-32\" />\n

\"lucide-react\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface LoaderProps {\n  size?: \"sm\" | \"md\" | \"lg\";\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nconst sizes = {\n  sm: \"h-4 w-4\",\n  md: \"h-6 w-6\",\n  lg: \"h-8 w-8\",\n};\n\nexport function Loader({ size = \"md\", className }: LoaderProps) {\n  return (\n    <Loader2\n      className={cn(\n        \"animate-spin text-zinc-500

justify-center min-h-[400px]\">\n      <Loader size=\"lg\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Next.js Loading Patterns\n\n**Route-level loading (loading.tsx):**\n\n```tsx\n// app/dashboard/loading.tsx\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nexport default function Loading() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-16\">\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6\">\n        {[...Array(6)].map((_, i) => (\n          <CardSkeleton key={i} />\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Component-level with Suspense:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { Suspense } from \"react\";\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nasync function TaskCards() {\n  const tasks = await fetchTasks();\n  return tasks.map(task => <TaskCard key={task.id} task={task} />);\n}\n\nexport default function DashboardPage() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton />}>\n      <TaskCards />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button loading state:**\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/Button\";\n\nexport function SubmitButton() {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async () => {\n    setLoading(true);\n    await submitForm();\n    setLoading(false);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Button loading={loading} onClick={handleSubmit}>\n      {loading ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cards & Containers\n\n### Card Types\n\n| Type | Border | Background | Plus Corners | Use |\n|------|--------|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Primary Card** | border-black | bg-white | No | Main containers |\n| **Featured Frame** | border-dashed border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Hero, highlights |\n| **Bento Card** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Grid layouts |\n| **Input/Badge** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | No | Form elements |\n\n### Card Patterns\n\n**Primary Card:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white bg-white dark:bg-black p-4\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</div>\n```\n\n**Featured Frame with Plus Corners:**\n```tsx\n<PlusCornerCard className=\"p-6 md:p-12\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</PlusCornerCard>\n```\n\n**Icon Container:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex h-12 w-12 items-center justify-center border border-black dark:border-white\">\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:check\" size={24} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Icons\n\n### Icon System: Iconify\n\nWe use Iconify for access to 200,000+ open source icons.\n\n#### Recommended Sets\n\n| Set | Prefix | Use Case |\n|-----|--------|----------|\n| **Lucide** | lucide: | Primary UI icons |\n| **Simple Icons** | simple-icons: | Brand/product logos |\n| **MDI** | mdi: | Additional coverage |\n| **Line-MD** | line-md: | Animated icons |\n\n#### Icon Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Icon.tsx\nimport { Icon as IconifyIcon } from \"@iconify-icon/react\";\n\ninterface IconProps {\n  icon: string;\n  size?: number;\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nexport function Icon({ icon, size = 24, className }: IconProps) {\n  return (\n    <IconifyIcon\n      icon={icon}\n      width={size}\n      height={size}\n      className={className}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Icon Sizes\n\n| Context | Size | Example |\n|---------|------|---------|\n| Inline with text | 16-18px | Menu items |\n| Card icons | 20-24px | Feature cards |\n| Featured icons | 24-32px | Hero elements |\n| Logo size | 32-48px | Header |\n\n#### Icon Colors\n\nIcons inherit text color:\n- `text-black dark:text-white` — Primary icons\n- `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` — Muted icons\n- Status colors for semantic icons\n\n---\n\n## Animation & Motion\n\n### Philosophy\n\nEntourage uses two distinct animation categories:\n\n1. **UI Animations** — Fast, functional, inform the user about state changes. These should feel instant and purposeful.\n2. **Ambient Animations** — Slow, atmospheric, create brand presence. These run in the background and establish visual rhythm without demanding attention.\n\nUI animations prioritize clarity. Ambient animations prioritize feel.\n\n### UI Animation Timing\n\n| Interaction | Duration | Easing | Purpose |\n|-------------|----------|--------|---------|\n| Hover state | Instant | — | Immediate feedback |\n| Color transitions | 150ms | ease-out | Smooth visual change |\n| Toggle/switch | 120ms | ease-in-out | Clear state change |\n| Page transition | 150ms | ease-out | Visual continuity |\n| Scroll reveal | 120ms | ease-out | Content appearance |\n| Button press | 100ms | ease-in | Tactile feedback |\n\n### Ambient Animation Timing\n\nAmbient animations create visual interest and brand atmosphere. They should be subtle enough to ignore but present enough to notice.\n\n| Animation | Duration | Use Case |\n|-----------|----------|----------|\n| Logo pulse | 2-3s | Subtle brand presence, hero sections |\n| Circuit signals | 3-5s | Data flow visualization, diagrams |\n| Infinite scroll | 20-25s | Logo carousels, social proof |\n| Plus Corner reveal | 150-200ms | Staggered entrance on card hover |\n\n### Framer Motion Patterns\n\n**Fade Up Entrance:**\n```tsx\nconst fadeUp = (delay: number) => ({\n  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  animate: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: {\n      duration: 0.15,\n      delay: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : delay,\n      ease: \"easeOut\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Staggered Children:**\n```tsx\nconst container = {\n  hidden: {},\n  visible: {\n    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 },\n  },\n};\n\nconst item = {\n  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  visible: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: { duration: 0.12, ease: \"easeOut\" },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### CSS Animations\n\n```css\n/* Subtle pulse for logos */\n@keyframes pulse-subtle {\n  0%, 100% {\n    opacity: 0.85;\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: scale(1.02);\n  }\n}\n\n.animate-pulse-slow {\n  animation: pulse-subtle 3s ease-in-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Infinite scroll for carousels */\n@keyframes scroll {\n  from { transform: translateX(0); }\n  to { transform: translateX(-50%); }\n}\n\n.animate-scroll {\n  animation: scroll linear infinite;\n}\n```\n\n### Reduced Motion\n\nAlways respect user preferences:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useReducedMotion } from \"framer-motion\";\n\nexport function AnimatedComponent() {\n  const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();\n\n  if (prefersReducedMotion) {\n    return <StaticVersion />;\n  }\n\n  return <AnimatedVersion />;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Dark Mode\n\n### Implementation\n\nDark mode is fully supported using Tailwind's dark variant and CSS custom properties.\n\n### Color Mapping\n\n| Element | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| Background | white (#FFFFFF) | black (#000000) |\n| Foreground text | black (#000000) | white (#FFFFFF) |\n| Muted text | zinc-500 (#71717A) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Label text | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) | zinc-500 (#71717A) |\n| Primary borders | black | white |\n| Dashed borders | zinc-200/zinc-300 | zinc-700/zinc-800 |\n| Plus corners | zinc-400 | zinc-600 |\n| Hover backgrounds | zinc-100 | zinc-800/zinc-900 |\n\n### Pattern\n\nAlways pair light and dark variants:\n\n```tsx\n// Text\nclassName=\"text-black dark:text-white\"\nclassName=\"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\"\n\n// Backgrounds\nclassName=\"bg-white dark:bg-black\"\nclassName=\"hover:bg-zinc-100 dark:hover:bg-zinc-800\"\n\n// Borders\nclassName=\"border-black dark:border-white\"\nclassName=\"border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Standard | Implementation |\n|-------------|----------|----------------|\n| Color contrast | WCAG AA 4.5:1 | Black on white, high contrast palette |\n| Focus indicators | Visible 2px | Ring with offset on all interactives |\n| Keyboard navigation | Logical tab order | Semantic HTML, proper focus management |\n| Screen readers | ARIA labels | Native elements, aria-label where needed |\n| Motion sensitivity | prefers-reduced-motion | useReducedMotion hook |\n\n### Touch Targets\n\nAll interactive elements: minimum **44×44px**.\n\n```tsx\n<button className=\"min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]\">\n```\n\n### Focus States\n\n```tsx\nclassName=\"focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-black focus:ring-offset-2\"\n```\n\n### Screen Reader Considerations\n\n```tsx\n// Icon-only buttons\n<button aria-label=\"Toggle dark mode\">\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:moon\" />\n</button>\n\n// Decorative elements\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" className=\"decorative-element\" />\n```\n\n---\n\n## Voice & Tone\n\n### Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Rational** | Facts over feelings, data over hype |\n| **Technical** | Precise language, no marketing fluff |\n| **Direct** | Say what you mean, no hedging |\n| **Authoritative** | Confident but not arrogant |\n\n### Writing Guidelines\n\n**Headlines:**\n- Active voice, present tense\n- Benefit-focused\n- 3-8 words optimal\n\n```\n✓ \"Know what needs to be done.\"\n✗ \"Our AI-powered platform helps you manage tasks.\"\n```\n\n**Error Messages:**\n- State the problem clearly\n- Provide actionable next steps\n- No cutesy language\n\n```\n✓ \"Failed to parse transcript.

The system features a distinctive **Plus Corner** motif as its signature brand element.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Objectivity** | Information over emotion. Let the data speak. |\n| **Precision** | Grid-based layouts, consistent spacing, sharp corners. |\n| **Clarity** | High contrast, readable typography, functional color. |\n| **Density** | Information-rich interfaces that respect the user's time. |\n| **Intentionality** | Every element has purpose. Brand elements (Plus Corners) create consistency; UI elements enable action. |\n\n### Design Inspiration\n\n| Source | What We Borrow |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Engineering drawings** | Sharp corners, measurement markers, construction guides |\n| **Vercel** | Technical precision, developer focus |\n| **Linear** | Dense information display, keyboard-first, monospace accents |\n\n### The Technical Blueprint Aesthetic\n\nThink of Entourage's interface as a technical drawing:\n- Sharp corners (0px radius everywhere)\n- Dashed/dotted borders as construction guides\n- Plus signs (+) as signature corner markers\n- Monospace text for data and labels\n- High contrast black/white with a vibrant accent palette\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n| Category | Technology |\n|----------|------------|\n| Framework | Next.js 16, React 19 |\n| Components | ShadcnUI (base) → Custom wrappers |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |\n| Animation | Framer Motion |\n| Icons | Iconify (Lucide primary, Simple Icons for brands) |\n| Fonts | Switzer (UI), Geist Mono (code/data) |\n\n---\n\n## Color System\n\n### Design Methodology\n\nColors are **functional signals**, not decoration. We use a strictly monochromatic base with semantic colors for status only.\n\n### Primary Palette: Monochrome\n\n```css\n/* Core — Brand foundation */\n--color-black:       #000000;   /* Primary text, borders (light mode) */\n--color-white:       #FFFFFF;   /* Backgrounds (light mode) */\n```\n\n### Gray Scale (Zinc)\n\n| Token | Hex | Light Mode Use | Dark Mode Use |\n|-------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| **zinc-50** | #FAFAFA | Subtle backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-100** | #F4F4F5 | Section backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-200** | #E4E4E7 | Dashed borders | — |\n| **zinc-300** | #D4D4D8 | Dotted borders, input borders | — |\n| **zinc-400** | #A1A1AA | Plus corners, labels | — |\n| **zinc-500** | #71717A | Muted text | Body text |\n| **zinc-600** | #52525B | — | Plus corners |\n| **zinc-700** | #3F3F46 | — | Dotted borders |\n| **zinc-800** | #27272A | — | Dashed borders |\n| **zinc-900** | #18181B | — | Backgrounds |\n\n### Accent Palette\n\nEntourage uses a vibrant, distinguishable accent palette for both brand expression and color coding within the service. These colors are carefully chosen to be visually distinct from each other and accessible on both light and dark backgrounds.\n\n| Color | Hex | Tailwind | Primary Use |\n|-------|-----|----------|-------------|\n| **Emerald** | #10B981 | emerald-500 | Primary accent, success, AI actions, active states |\n| **Violet** | #8B5CF6 | violet-500 | Categories, tags, special elements |\n| **Amber** | #F59E0B | amber-500 | Warnings, attention, pending states |\n| **Rose** | #F43F5E | rose-500 | Errors, destructive actions, urgent |\n| **Sky** | #0EA5E9 | sky-500 | Information, links, secondary actions |\n\n### Semantic Mapping\n\nColors serve double duty: brand expression AND functional meaning.\n\n| Semantic | Color | Use Cases |\n|----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Success** | Emerald | Completed tasks, active status, confirmations |\n| **AI/Processing** | Emerald | AI-powered features, processing indicators |\n| **Warning** | Amber | Pending review, attention needed |\n| **Error** | Rose | Failed actions, validation errors |\n| **Info** | Sky | Informational messages, links |\n| **Special** | Violet | Tags, categories, premium features |\n\n### Color Coding Guidelines\n\nWhen using colors for categorization or tagging:\n- Use the full palette for maximum distinction\n- Pair color with text labels for accessibility\n- Maintain consistent meaning across the product\n- Use 10% opacity backgrounds with full-color text/borders\n\n### Color Pairing Rules\n\n| Context | Background | Text | Border | Hover BG |\n|---------|------------|------|--------|----------|\n| **Page (light)** | white | black | — | — |\n| **Page (dark)** | black | white | — | — |\n| **Card (light)** | white | black | black or zinc-300 | zinc-50 |\n| **Card (dark)** | black | white | white or zinc-700 | zinc-900 |\n| **Primary Button** | white | black | black | zinc-100 |\n| **Solid Button** | black | white | black | zinc-800 |\n| **Muted Text (light)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Muted Text (dark)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (dark)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (dark)** | — | zinc-600 | — | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (light)** | — | — | zinc-200 | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (dark)** | — | — | zinc-800 | — |\n\n### Color Application Rules\n\n1. **Never use color decoratively** — Every color must have semantic meaning\n2. **Pair color with context** — A colored element alone isn't enough; add text or icon\n3. **Use tints for backgrounds** — Full color for text/borders, 10% opacity for backgrounds\n4. **Maintain contrast** — All text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)\n\n### CSS Variables (globals.css)\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode */\n  --background: #FFFFFF;\n  --foreground: #171717;\n  --card: #FFFFFF;\n  --card-foreground: #171717;\n  --primary: #171717;\n

xl: |\n\n---\n\n## Shadow System\n\n### Philosophy\n\nShadows in Entourage are **minimal and purposeful**. The blueprint aesthetic favors flat design, but subtle shadows can indicate elevation when needed.\n\n### Shadow Tokens\n\n```css\n/* Light mode shadows */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n\n/* Dark mode shadows (deeper, less visible) */\n--shadow-card-dark: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n--shadow-card-hover-dark: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n--shadow-lg-dark: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\n### Shadow Usage\n\n| Element | Shadow | Use Case |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Buttons** | none | Flat by default (use borders) |\n| **Cards at rest** | shadow-sm or none | Minimal elevation |\n| **Cards on hover** | shadow-card-hover | Subtle lift effect |\n| **Dropdowns** | shadow-lg | Floating above content |\n| **Modals** | shadow-xl | Highest elevation |\n| **Toasts** | shadow-lg | Notification prominence |\n\n### When to Use Shadows\n\n**Use shadows for:**\n- Floating elements (dropdowns, popovers, modals)\n- Interactive card hover states\n- Toast notifications\n\n**Avoid shadows on:**\n- Static cards (prefer borders)\n- Buttons (use border states)\n- Navigation elements\n- Within the main content flow\n\n---\n\n## Plus Corner System\n\n### Concept\n\nThe Plus Corner is Entourage's **signature decorative element** — four plus signs (+) that mark the corners of featured containers. This is derived from technical blueprints where plus marks indicate measurement points.\n\n```\n   +───────────────────────────+\n   ╎                           ╎\n   ╎     Content Area          ╎\n   ╎                           ╎\n   +───────────────────────────+\n```\n\n### Plus Corner Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Specifications\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Size | 20px × 20px (w-5 h-5) |\n| Position offset | 10px from corner (-top-2.5 -left-2.5) |\n| Stroke width | 1px |\n| Color (light) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Color (dark) | zinc-600 (#52525B) |\n\n### Opacity Tiers\n\nThree-tier system for consistent application:\n\n| Tier | Opacity | Use Case |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| **Subtle** | 50% (opacity-50) | Background decoration, static frames |\n| **Default** | 100% | Standard cards, featured sections |\n| **Emphasis** | 100% + scale | Hover states with slight grow effect |\n\n### Animation (Staggered Reveal)\n\nFor enhanced interactivity, Plus Corners can animate in with a stagger effect:\n\n```css\n.plus-corner {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.8);\n  transition:\n    opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1),\n    transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n}\n\n/* Stagger delays */\n.plus-corner--tl { transition-delay: 0ms; }\n.plus-corner--tr { transition-delay: 50ms; }\n.plus-corner--bl { transition-delay: 100ms; }\n.plus-corner--br { transition-delay: 150ms; }\n\n/* Visible state */\n.group:hover .plus-corner {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1);\n}\n\n/* Reduced motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .plus-corner {\n    transition: opacity 0ms;\n    transform: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Hover Enhancement (Optional)\n\nFor interactive cards, Plus Corners can subtly shift color on hover:\n\n```tsx\n<PlusCorner\n  className={cn(\n    \"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5\",\n    \"text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    \"transition-colors duration-150\",\n    \"group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\n### Full Implementation\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function PlusCornerCard({\n  children,\n  className,\n  dashed = true,\n  interactive = false\n}: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  const cornerClass = cn(\n    \"absolute w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        \"group relative\",\n        dashed\n          ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n          : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n        \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### SVG Implementation (Embedded Graphics)\n\nWhen Plus Corners appear inside an SVG:\n\n```svg\n<g class=\"stroke-zinc-400 dark:stroke-zinc-600\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\">\n  <!-- Plus at position (x, y) with 5px arms -->\n  <path d=\"M x y-5 v 10 M x-5 y h 10\" />\n</g>\n```\n\n### Exclusion List (When NOT to Use)\n\nDo **not** apply Plus Corners to:\n\n| Element | Reason |\n|---------|--------|\n| Body text/paragraphs | Decorative noise |\n| Icons | Too small, cluttered |\n| Inline links | Disrupts reading flow |\n| Buttons | Use border states instead |\n| Navigation items | Use underline/color |\n| Toast notifications | Keep minimal |\n| Tooltips | Too small |\n| Very small components (< 80px) | Corners overwhelm content |\n| Footer | Keep simple |\n| Form inputs | Use focus states |\n\n### Application Contexts\n\n| Element | Plus Corners | Style |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **Hero section** | Yes | Dashed border + corners |\n| **Feature cards** | Yes | Dashed or solid |\n| **Bento grid items** | Yes | Default opacity |\n| **Images/media frames** | Yes, subtle | 50% opacity |\n| **Section dividers** | Optional | At endpoints only |\n| **Buttons** | No | — |\n| **Inputs** | No | — |\n\n---\n\n## Borders & Dividers\n\n### Border Styles\n\n| Type | Class | Use |\n|------|-------|-----|\n| **Solid** | `border` | Cards, buttons, primary containers |\n| **Dashed** | `border-dashed` | Featured frames, hero sections |\n| **Dotted** | `border-dotted` or SVG | Embedded graphics, construction guides |\n\n### Border Colors\n\n| Context | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| **Primary borders** | border-black | border-white |\n| **Card borders** | border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 |\n| **Dashed frames** | border-zinc-200 or border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 or border-zinc-800 |\n| **Subtle dividers** | border-zinc-200 | border-zinc-800 |\n\n### Border Width\n\n| Width | Class | Use |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| 1px | border | Standard borders |\n| 2px | border-2 | Emphasis, focus states |\n\n---\n\n## Components (ShadcnUI Patterns)\n\n### Component Wrapper Philosophy\n\n**Never edit ShadcnUI components directly.** Create wrapper components that apply brand styling.\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadcnUI primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx

{loading && <Loader2 className=\"mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin\" />}\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button States:**\n\n| State | Visual |\n|-------|--------|\n| Default | As specified by variant |\n| Hover | Background shifts (zinc-100/zinc-800) |\n| Focus | 2px black ring with offset |\n| Disabled | 50% opacity, not-allowed cursor |\n| Loading | Spinner icon, disabled state |\n\n**Button Usage:**\n\n| Context | Recommended Variant |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| Primary CTA (Join Waitlist) | solid |\n| Header navigation | secondary |\n| Card actions | primary |\n| Inline/tertiary actions | ghost |\n\n### Dialog (Modal)\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Dialog with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Dialog.tsx\nimport {\n  Dialog as ShadcnDialog,\n

<Button variant=\"ghost\">Cancel</Button>\n      </DialogClose>\n      <Button variant=\"solid\">Confirm</Button>\n    </DialogFooter>\n  </DialogContent>\n</Dialog>\n```\n\n### Table\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Table with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Table.tsx\nimport {\n  Table as ShadcnTable,\n  TableBody,\n  TableCell,\n  TableHead,\n  TableHeader,\n  TableRow as ShadcnTableRow,\n} from \"@/components/ui/table\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype TableProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnTable>;\ntype TableRowProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnTableRow>;\n\nexport function Table({ className, ...props }: TableProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white\">\n

className=\"text-green-600\">Complete</span>\n      </TableCell>\n    </TableRow>\n  </TableBody>\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Toast (Sonner)\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add sonner\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\nimport { Toaster } from \"@/components/ui/sonner\";\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <Toaster\n          position=\"bottom-right\"\n          toastOptions={{\n            className: cn(\n              \"rounded-none\",\n              \"border

},\n});\n```\n\n**Toast Rules:**\n- Toasts do NOT get Plus Corners (exclusion list)\n- Keep messages concise (< 60 characters)\n- Use semantic variants (success, error, warning)\n- Position: bottom-right (default)\n\n---\n\n## Loading States\n\n### Skeleton\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Skeleton with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Skeleton.tsx\nimport { Skeleton as ShadcnSkeleton } from \"@/components/ui/skeleton\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype SkeletonProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnSkeleton>;\n\nexport function Skeleton({ className, ...props }: SkeletonProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnSkeleton\n      className={cn(\n        \"rounded-none\",\n        \"bg-zinc-200 dark:bg-zinc-800\",\n        className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Skeleton Patterns\n\n**Card Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function CardSkeleton() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 p-6 space-y-4\">\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-40 w-full\" />     {/* Image */}\n      <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-24\" />        {/* Label */}\n      <Skeleton

*/}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Table Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function TableSkeleton({ rows = 5 }: { rows?: number }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white\">\n      <div className=\"border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 p-4\">\n        <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-32\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-24\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-20\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      {[...Array(rows)].map((_, i) => (\n        <div key={i} className=\"border-b

<Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-16\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Loader (Spinner)\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Loader.tsx\nimport { Loader2 } from \"lucide-react\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface LoaderProps {\n  size?: \"sm\" | \"md\" | \"lg\";\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nconst sizes = {\n  sm: \"h-4 w-4\",\n  md: \"h-6 w-6\",\n  lg: \"h-8 w-8\",\n};\n\nexport function Loader({ size = \"md\", className }: LoaderProps) {\n  return (\n    <Loader2\n      className={cn(\n        \"animate-spin text-zinc-500

justify-center min-h-[400px]\">\n      <Loader size=\"lg\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Next.js Loading Patterns\n\n**Route-level loading (loading.tsx):**\n\n```tsx\n// app/dashboard/loading.tsx\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nexport default function Loading() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-16\">\n      <div

);\n}\n```\n\n**Component-level with Suspense:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { Suspense } from \"react\";\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nasync function TaskCards() {\n  const tasks = await fetchTasks();\n  return tasks.map(task => <TaskCard key={task.id} task={task} />);\n}\n\nexport default function DashboardPage() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton />}>\n      <TaskCards />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button loading state:**\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/Button\";\n\nexport function SubmitButton() {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async () => {\n    setLoading(true);\n    await submitForm();\n    setLoading(false);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Button loading={loading} onClick={handleSubmit}>\n      {loading ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cards & Containers\n\n### Card Types\n\n| Type | Border | Background | Plus Corners | Use |\n|------|--------|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Primary Card** | border-black | bg-white | No | Main containers |\n| **Featured Frame** | border-dashed border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Hero, highlights |\n| **Bento Card** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Grid layouts |\n| **Input/Badge** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | No | Form

icon, size = 24, className }: IconProps) {\n  return (\n    <IconifyIcon\n      icon={icon}\n      width={size}\n      height={size}\n      className={className}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Icon Sizes\n\n| Context | Size | Example |\n|---------|------|---------|\n| Inline with text | 16-18px | Menu items |\n| Card icons | 20-24px | Feature cards |\n| Featured icons | 24-32px | Hero elements |\n| Logo size | 32-48px | Header |\n\n#### Icon Colors\n\nIcons inherit text color:\n- `text-black dark:text-white` — Primary icons\n- `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` — Muted icons\n- Status colors for semantic icons\n\n---\n\n## Animation & Motion\n\n### Philosophy\n\nEntourage uses two distinct animation categories:\n\n1. **UI Animations** — Fast, functional, inform the user about state changes. These should feel instant and purposeful.\n2. **Ambient Animations** — Slow, atmospheric, create brand presence. These run in the background and establish visual rhythm without demanding attention.\n\nUI animations prioritize clarity. Ambient animations prioritize feel.\n\n### UI Animation Timing\n\n| Interaction | Duration | Easing | Purpose |\n|-------------|----------|--------|---------|\n| Hover state | Instant | — | Immediate feedback |\n| Color transitions | 150ms | ease-out | Smooth visual change |\n| Toggle/switch | 120ms | ease-in-out | Clear state change |\n| Page transition | 150ms | ease-out | Visual continuity |\n| Scroll reveal | 120ms | ease-out | Content appearance |\n| Button press | 100ms | ease-in | Tactile feedback |\n\n### Ambient Animation Timing\n\nAmbient animations create visual interest and brand atmosphere. They should be subtle enough to ignore but present enough to notice.\n\n| Animation | Duration | Use Case |\n|-----------|----------|----------|\n| Logo pulse | 2-3s | Subtle brand presence, hero sections |\n| Circuit signals | 3-5s | Data flow visualization, diagrams |\n| Infinite scroll | 20-25s | Logo carousels, social proof |\n| Plus Corner reveal | 150-200ms | Staggered entrance on card hover |\n\n### Framer Motion Patterns\n\n**Fade Up Entrance:**\n```tsx\nconst fadeUp = (delay: number) => ({\n  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  animate: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: {\n      duration: 0.15,\n      delay: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : delay,\n      ease: \"easeOut\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Staggered Children:**\n```tsx\nconst container = {\n  hidden: {},\n  visible: {\n    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 },\n  },\n};\n\nconst item = {\n  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  visible: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: { duration: 0.12, ease: \"easeOut\" },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### CSS Animations\n\n```css\n/* Subtle pulse for logos */\n@keyframes pulse-subtle {\n  0%, 100% {\n    opacity: 0.85;\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: scale(1.02);\n  }\n}\n\n.animate-pulse-slow {\n  animation: pulse-subtle 3s ease-in-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Infinite scroll for carousels */\n@keyframes scroll {\n  from { transform: translateX(0); }\n  to { transform: translateX(-50%); }\n}\n\n.animate-scroll {\n  animation: scroll linear infinite;\n}\n```\n\n### Reduced Motion\n\nAlways respect user preferences:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useReducedMotion } from \"framer-motion\";\n\nexport function AnimatedComponent() {\n  const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();\n\n  if (prefersReducedMotion) {\n    return <StaticVersion />;\n  }\n\n  return <AnimatedVersion />;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Dark Mode\n\n### Implementation\n\nDark mode is fully supported using Tailwind's dark variant and CSS custom properties.\n\n### Color Mapping\n\n| Element | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| Background | white (#FFFFFF) | black (#000000) |\n| Foreground text | black (#000000) | white (#FFFFFF) |\n| Muted text | zinc-500 (#71717A) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Label text | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) | zinc-500 (#71717A) |\n| Primary borders | black | white |\n| Dashed borders | zinc-200/zinc-300 | zinc-700/zinc-800 |\n| Plus corners | zinc-400 | zinc-600 |\n| Hover backgrounds | zinc-100 | zinc-800/zinc-900 |\n\n### Pattern\n\nAlways pair light and dark variants:\n\n```tsx\n// Text\nclassName=\"text-black dark:text-white\"\nclassName=\"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\"\n\n// Backgrounds\nclassName=\"bg-white dark:bg-black\"\nclassName=\"hover:bg-zinc-100 dark:hover:bg-zinc-800\"\n\n// Borders\nclassName=\"border-black dark:border-white\"\nclassName=\"border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nAccessibility is a core requirement, not an afterthought.

The system features a distinctive **Plus Corner** motif as its signature brand element.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Objectivity** | Information over emotion. Let the data speak. |\n| **Precision** | Grid-based layouts, consistent spacing, sharp corners. |\n| **Clarity** | High contrast, readable typography, functional color. |\n| **Density** | Information-rich interfaces that respect the user's time. |\n| **Intentionality** | Every element has purpose. Brand elements (Plus Corners) create consistency; UI elements enable action. |\n\n### Design Inspiration\n\n| Source | What We Borrow |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Engineering drawings** | Sharp corners, measurement markers, construction guides |\n| **Vercel** | Technical precision, developer focus |\n| **Linear** | Dense information display, keyboard-first, monospace accents |\n\n### The Technical Blueprint Aesthetic\n\nThink of Entourage's interface as a technical drawing:\n- Sharp corners (0px radius everywhere)\n- Dashed/dotted borders as construction guides\n- Plus signs (+) as signature corner markers\n- Monospace text for data and labels\n- High contrast black/white with a vibrant accent palette\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n| Category | Technology |\n|----------|------------|\n| Framework | Next.js 16, React 19 |\n| Components | ShadcnUI (base) → Custom wrappers |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |\n| Animation | Framer Motion |\n| Icons | Iconify (Lucide primary, Simple Icons for brands) |\n| Fonts | Switzer (UI), Geist Mono (code/data) |\n\n---\n\n## Color System\n\n### Design Methodology\n\nColors are **functional signals**, not decoration. We use a strictly monochromatic base with semantic colors for status only.\n\n### Primary Palette: Monochrome\n\n```css\n/* Core — Brand foundation */\n--color-black:       #000000;   /* Primary text, borders (light mode) */\n--color-white:       #FFFFFF;   /* Backgrounds (light mode) */\n```\n\n### Gray Scale (Zinc)\n\n| Token | Hex | Light Mode Use | Dark Mode Use |\n|-------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| **zinc-50** | #FAFAFA | Subtle backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-100** | #F4F4F5 | Section backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-200** | #E4E4E7 | Dashed borders | — |\n| **zinc-300** | #D4D4D8 | Dotted borders, input borders | — |\n| **zinc-400** | #A1A1AA | Plus corners, labels | — |\n| **zinc-500** | #71717A | Muted text | Body text |\n| **zinc-600** | #52525B | — | Plus corners |\n| **zinc-700** | #3F3F46 | — | Dotted borders |\n| **zinc-800** | #27272A | — | Dashed borders |\n| **zinc-900** | #18181B | — | Backgrounds |\n\n### Accent Palette\n\nEntourage uses a vibrant, distinguishable accent palette for both brand expression and color coding within the service. These colors are carefully chosen to be visually distinct from each other and accessible on both light and dark backgrounds.\n\n| Color | Hex | Tailwind | Primary Use |\n|-------|-----|----------|-------------|\n| **Emerald** | #10B981 | emerald-500 | Primary accent, success, AI actions, active states |\n| **Violet** | #8B5CF6 | violet-500 | Categories, tags, special elements |\n| **Amber** | #F59E0B | amber-500 | Warnings, attention, pending states |\n| **Rose** | #F43F5E | rose-500 | Errors, destructive actions, urgent |\n| **Sky** | #0EA5E9 | sky-500 | Information, links, secondary actions |\n\n### Semantic Mapping\n\nColors serve double duty: brand expression AND functional meaning.\n\n| Semantic | Color | Use Cases |\n|----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Success** | Emerald | Completed tasks, active status, confirmations |\n| **AI/Processing** | Emerald | AI-powered features, processing indicators |\n| **Warning** | Amber | Pending review, attention needed |\n| **Error** | Rose | Failed actions, validation errors |\n| **Info** | Sky | Informational messages, links |\n| **Special** | Violet | Tags, categories, premium features |\n\n### Color Coding Guidelines\n\nWhen using colors for categorization or tagging:\n- Use the full palette for maximum distinction\n- Pair color with text labels for accessibility\n- Maintain consistent meaning across the product\n- Use 10% opacity backgrounds with full-color text/borders\n\n### Color Pairing Rules\n\n| Context | Background | Text | Border | Hover BG |\n|---------|------------|------|--------|----------|\n| **Page (light)** | white | black | — | — |\n| **Page (dark)** | black | white | — | — |\n| **Card (light)** | white | black | black or zinc-300 | zinc-50 |\n| **Card (dark)** | black | white | white or zinc-700 | zinc-900 |\n| **Primary Button** | white | black | black | zinc-100 |\n| **Solid Button** | black | white | black | zinc-800 |\n| **Muted Text (light)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Muted Text (dark)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (dark)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (dark)** | — | zinc-600 | — | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (light)** | — | — | zinc-200 | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (dark)** | — | — | zinc-800 | — |\n\n### Color Application Rules\n\n1. **Never use color decoratively** — Every color must have semantic meaning\n2. **Pair color with context** — A colored element alone isn't enough; add text or icon\n3. **Use tints for backgrounds** — Full color for text/borders, 10% opacity for backgrounds\n4. **Maintain contrast** — All text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)\n\n### CSS Variables (globals.css)\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode */\n  --background: #FFFFFF;\n  --foreground: #171717;\n  --card: #FFFFFF;\n  --card-foreground: #171717;\n  --primary: #171717;\n

 subsets: [\"latin\"],\n});\n```\n\n### Type Scale\n\n| Size | Tailwind | Pixels | Use |\n|------|----------|--------|-----|\n| xs | text-xs | 12px | Labels, tags, metadata |\n| sm | text-sm | 14px | Secondary text, descriptions |\n| base | text-base | 16px | Body text, paragraphs |\n| lg | text-lg | 18px | Large body, card titles |\n| xl | text-xl | 20px | Section subtitles |\n| 2xl | text-2xl | 24px | Section headings (mobile) |\n| 3xl | text-3xl | 30px | Section headings (desktop) |\n| 4xl | text-4xl | 36px | Hero text (mobile) |\n| 5xl | text-5xl | 48px | Hero text (tablet) |\n| 6xl | text-6xl | 60px | Hero text (desktop) |\n\n### Font Weights\n\n| Weight | Tailwind | Use |\n|--------|----------|-----|\n| 400 | font-normal | Body text, descriptions |\n| 500 | font-medium | Emphasized body, buttons, labels |\n| 600 | font-semibold | Headings, titles |\n| 700 | font-bold | Hero headlines, CTAs |\n\n### Typography Patterns\n\n**Hero Headline:**\n```tsx\n<h1 className=\"text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white\">\n```\n\n**Hero Subheadline (muted):**\n```tsx\n<p className=\"text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n```\n\n**Section Label:**\n```tsx\n<span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n```\n\n**Section Title:**\n```tsx\n<h2 className=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-black dark:text-white\">\n```\n\n**Body Text:**\n```tsx\n<p className=\"text-base text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n```\n\n**Monospace Label:**\n```tsx\n<span className=\"font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n```\n\n### Line Heights & Letter Spacing\n\n| Context | Line Height | Letter Spacing |\n|---------|-------------|----------------|\n| Headlines | leading-tight (1.2) | tracking-tight (-0.01em) |\n| Body text | leading-relaxed (1.4) | tracking-normal (0) |\n| Labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-wider (0.05em) |\n| Uppercase labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-widest (0.1em) |\n\n---\n\n## Spacing & Layout\n\n### Base Unit: 8px Grid\n\nAll spacing snaps to an 8px grid.\n\n| Unit | Pixels | Tailwind | Use |\n|------|--------|----------|-----|\n| 0.5 | 2px | 0.5 | Micro adjustments |\n| 1 | 4px | 1 | Tight inline gaps |\n| 2 | 8px | 2 | Standard padding, icon gaps |\n| 3 | 12px | 3 | Small component gaps |\n| 4 | 16px | 4 | Component padding, margins |\n| 6 | 24px | 6 | Section inner padding |\n| 8 | 32px | 8 | Component margins |\n| 12 | 48px | 12 | Section gaps |\n| 16 | 64px | 16 | Large section padding |\n| 24 | 96px | 24 | Hero spacing |\n\n### Container\n\n```tsx\n<div className=\"mx-auto w-full max-w-5xl px-6 md:px-12\">\n  {children}\n</div>\n```\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Maximum width | 1024px (max-w-5xl) |\n| Horizontal padding (mobile) | 24px (px-6) |\n| Horizontal padding (desktop) | 48px (md:px-12) |\n\n### Section Padding\n\n| Pattern | Class | Use |\n|---------|-------|-----|\n| **Hero** | `pt-28 pb-16 sm:pt-32 sm:pb-24 md:pt-40 md:pb-32` | First section with nav offset |\n| **Standard** | `py-16 md:py-24` | Most content sections |\n| **Compact** | `py-12 md:py-16` | Secondary sections |\n| **Footer** | `py-8` | Footer content |\n\n### Responsive Breakpoints\n\n| Breakpoint | Width | Prefix |\n|------------|-------|--------|\n| Mobile | < 640px | (default) |\n| Small | ≥ 640px | sm: |\n| Medium | ≥ 768px | md: |\n| Large | ≥ 1024px | lg: |\n| XL | ≥ 1280px | xl: |\n\n---\n\n## Shadow System\n\n### Philosophy\n\nShadows in Entourage are **minimal and purposeful**. The blueprint aesthetic favors flat design, but subtle shadows can indicate elevation when needed.\n\n### Shadow Tokens\n\n```css\n/* Light mode shadows */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n\n/* Dark mode shadows (deeper, less visible) */\n--shadow-card-dark: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n--shadow-card-hover-dark: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n--shadow-lg-dark: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\n### Shadow Usage\n\n| Element | Shadow | Use Case |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Buttons** | none | Flat by default (use borders) |\n| **Cards at rest** | shadow-sm or none | Minimal elevation |\n| **Cards on hover** | shadow-card-hover | Subtle lift effect |\n| **Dropdowns** | shadow-lg | Floating above content |\n| **Modals** | shadow-xl | Highest elevation |\n| **Toasts** | shadow-lg | Notification prominence |\n\n### When to Use Shadows\n\n**Use shadows for:**\n- Floating elements (dropdowns, popovers, modals)\n- Interactive card hover states\n- Toast notifications\n\n**Avoid shadows on:**\n- Static cards (prefer borders)\n- Buttons (use border states)\n- Navigation elements\n- Within the main content flow\n\n---\n\n## Plus Corner System\n\n### Concept\n\nThe Plus Corner is Entourage's **signature decorative element** — four plus signs (+) that mark the corners of featured containers. This is derived from technical blueprints where plus marks indicate measurement points.\n\n```\n   +───────────────────────────+\n   ╎                           ╎\n   ╎     Content Area          ╎\n   ╎                           ╎\n   +───────────────────────────+\n```\n\n### Plus Corner Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Specifications\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Size | 20px × 20px (w-5 h-5) |\n| Position offset | 10px from corner (-top-2.5 -left-2.5) |\n| Stroke width | 1px |\n| Color (light) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Color (dark) | zinc-600 (#52525B) |\n\n### Opacity Tiers\n\nThree-tier system for consistent application:\n\n| Tier | Opacity | Use Case |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| **Subtle** | 50% (opacity-50) | Background decoration, static frames |\n| **Default** | 100% | Standard cards, featured sections |\n| **Emphasis** | 100% + scale | Hover states with slight grow effect |\n\n### Animation (Staggered Reveal)\n\nFor enhanced interactivity, Plus Corners can animate in with a stagger effect:\n\n```css\n.plus-corner {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.8);\n  transition:\n    opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1),\n    transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n}\n\n/* Stagger delays */\n.plus-corner--tl { transition-delay: 0ms; }\n.plus-corner--tr { transition-delay: 50ms; }\n.plus-corner--bl { transition-delay: 100ms; }\n.plus-corner--br { transition-delay: 150ms; }\n\n/* Visible state */\n.group:hover .plus-corner {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1);\n}\n\n/* Reduced motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .plus-corner {\n    transition: opacity 0ms;\n    transform: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Hover Enhancement (Optional)\n\nFor interactive cards, Plus Corners can subtly shift color on hover:\n\n```tsx\n<PlusCorner\n  className={cn(\n    \"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5\",\n    \"text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    \"transition-colors duration-150\",\n    \"group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\n### Full Implementation\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function PlusCornerCard({\n  children,\n  className,\n  dashed = true,\n  interactive = false\n}: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  const cornerClass = cn(\n    \"absolute w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        \"group relative\",\n        dashed\n          ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n          : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n        \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### SVG Implementation (Embedded Graphics)\n\nWhen Plus Corners appear inside an SVG:\n\n```svg\n<g class=\"stroke-zinc-400 dark:stroke-zinc-600\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\">\n  <!-- Plus at position (x, y) with 5px arms -->\n  <path d=\"M x y-5 v 10 M x-5 y h 10\" />\n</g>\n```\n\n### Exclusion List (When NOT to Use)\n\nDo **not** apply Plus Corners to:\n\n| Element | Reason |\n|---------|--------|\n| Body text/paragraphs | Decorative noise |\n| Icons | Too small, cluttered |\n| Inline links | Disrupts reading flow |\n| Buttons | Use border states instead |\n| Navigation items | Use underline/color |\n| Toast notifications | Keep minimal |\n| Tooltips | Too small |\n| Very small components (< 80px) | Corners overwhelm content |\n| Footer | Keep simple |\n| Form inputs | Use focus states |\n\n### Application Contexts\n\n| Element | Plus Corners | Style |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **Hero section** | Yes | Dashed border + corners |\n| **Feature cards** | Yes | Dashed or solid |\n| **Bento grid items** | Yes | Default opacity |\n| **Images/media frames** | Yes, subtle | 50% opacity |\n| **Section dividers** | Optional | At endpoints only |\n| **Buttons** | No | — |\n| **Inputs** | No | — |\n\n---\n\n## Borders & Dividers\n\n### Border Styles\n\n| Type | Class | Use |\n|------|-------|-----|\n| **Solid** | `border` | Cards, buttons, primary containers |\n| **Dashed** | `border-dashed` | Featured frames, hero sections |\n| **Dotted** | `border-dotted` or SVG | Embedded graphics, construction guides |\n\n### Border Colors\n\n| Context | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| **Primary borders** | border-black | border-white |\n| **Card borders** | border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 |\n| **Dashed frames** | border-zinc-200 or border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 or border-zinc-800 |\n| **Subtle dividers** | border-zinc-200 | border-zinc-800 |\n\n### Border Width\n\n| Width | Class | Use |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| 1px | border | Standard borders |\n| 2px | border-2 | Emphasis, focus states |\n\n---\n\n## Components (ShadcnUI Patterns)\n\n### Component Wrapper Philosophy\n\n**Never edit ShadcnUI components directly.** Create wrapper components that apply brand styling.\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadcnUI primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx         # Raw ShadcnUI\n│   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   └── ...\n├── Button.tsx             # Entourage wrapper (CUSTOMIZE HERE)\n├── Dialog.tsx             # Entourage wrapper\n└── ...\n```\n\n### Button\n\n**Base:** Custom implementation following Entourage brand.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/Button.tsx\nimport { ButtonHTMLAttributes, ReactNode } from \"react\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport { Loader2 } from \"lucide-react\";\n\ninterface ButtonProps extends ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {\n  children: ReactNode;\n  variant?: \"primary\" | \"solid\" |

min-w-[44px]\",\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      className={cn(baseStyles, variants[variant], sizes[size], className)}\n      disabled={disabled || loading}\n      {...props}\n    >\n      {loading && <Loader2 className=\"mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin\" />}\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button States:**\n\n| State | Visual |\n|-------|--------|\n| Default | As specified by variant |\n| Hover | Background shifts (zinc-100/zinc-800) |\n| Focus | 2px black ring with offset |\n| Disabled | 50% opacity, not-allowed cursor |\n| Loading | Spinner icon, disabled state |\n\n**Button Usage:**\n\n| Context | Recommended Variant |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| Primary CTA (Join Waitlist) | solid |\n| Header navigation | secondary |\n| Card actions | primary |\n| Inline/tertiary actions | ghost |\n\n### Dialog (Modal)\n\n**Base:** ShadcnUI Dialog with Entourage styling.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Dialog.tsx\nimport {\n  Dialog as ShadcnDialog,\n  DialogContent as ShadcnDialogContent,\n  DialogDescription,\n  DialogHeader,\n  DialogTitle,\n  DialogTrigger,\n  DialogFooter,\n  DialogClose,\n} from \"@/components/ui/dialog\";\nimport { cn } from

*/}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Table Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function TableSkeleton({ rows = 5 }: { rows?: number }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white\">\n      <div className=\"border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 p-4\">\n        <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-32\" />\n

justify-center min-h-[400px]\">\n      <Loader size=\"lg\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Next.js Loading Patterns\n\n**Route-level loading (loading.tsx):**\n\n```tsx\n// app/dashboard/loading.tsx\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nexport default function Loading() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-16\">\n      <div

);\n}\n```\n\n**Component-level with Suspense:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { Suspense } from \"react\";\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nasync function TaskCards() {\n  const tasks = await fetchTasks();\n  return tasks.map(task => <TaskCard key={task.id} task={task} />);\n}\n\nexport default function DashboardPage() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton />}>\n      <TaskCards />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button loading state:**\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/Button\";\n\nexport function SubmitButton() {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async () => {\n    setLoading(true);\n    await submitForm();\n    setLoading(false);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Button loading={loading} onClick={handleSubmit}>\n      {loading ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cards & Containers\n\n### Card Types\n\n| Type | Border | Background | Plus Corners | Use |\n|------|--------|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Primary Card** | border-black | bg-white | No | Main containers |\n| **Featured Frame** | border-dashed border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Hero, highlights |\n| **Bento Card** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Grid layouts |\n| **Input/Badge** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | No | Form elements |\n\n### Card Patterns\n\n**Primary Card:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white bg-white dark:bg-black p-4\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</div>\n```\n\n**Featured Frame with Plus Corners:**\n```tsx\n<PlusCornerCard className=\"p-6 md:p-12\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</PlusCornerCard>\n```\n\n**Icon Container:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex h-12 w-12 items-center justify-center border border-black dark:border-white\">\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:check\" size={24} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Icons\n\n### Icon System: Iconify\n\nWe use Iconify for access to 200,000+ open source icons.\n\n#### Recommended Sets\n\n| Set | Prefix | Use Case |\n|-----|--------|----------|\n| **Lucide** | lucide: | Primary UI icons |\n| **Simple Icons** | simple-icons: | Brand/product logos |\n| **MDI** | mdi: | Additional coverage |\n| **Line-MD** | line-md: | Animated icons |\n\n#### Icon Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Icon.tsx\nimport { Icon as IconifyIcon } from \"@iconify-icon/react\";\n\ninterface IconProps {\n  icon: string;\n  size?: number;\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nexport function Icon({ icon, size = 24, className }: IconProps) {\n  return (\n    <IconifyIcon\n      icon={icon}\n      width={size}\n      height={size}\n      className={className}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Icon Sizes\n\n| Context | Size | Example |\n|---------|------|---------|\n| Inline with text | 16-18px | Menu items |\n| Card icons | 20-24px | Feature cards |\n| Featured icons | 24-32px | Hero elements |\n| Logo size | 32-48px | Header |\n\n#### Icon Colors\n\nIcons inherit text color:\n- `text-black dark:text-white` — Primary icons\n- `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` — Muted icons\n- Status colors for semantic icons\n\n---\n\n## Animation & Motion\n\n### Philosophy\n\nEntourage uses two distinct animation categories:\n\n1. **UI Animations** — Fast, functional, inform the user about state changes. These should feel instant and purposeful.\n2. **Ambient Animations** — Slow, atmospheric, create brand presence. These run in the background and establish visual rhythm without demanding attention.\n\nUI animations prioritize clarity. Ambient animations prioritize feel.\n\n### UI Animation Timing\n\n| Interaction | Duration | Easing | Purpose |\n|-------------|----------|--------|---------|\n| Hover state | Instant | — | Immediate feedback |\n| Color transitions | 150ms | ease-out | Smooth visual change |\n| Toggle/switch | 120ms | ease-in-out | Clear state change |\n| Page transition | 150ms | ease-out | Visual continuity |\n| Scroll reveal | 120ms | ease-out | Content appearance |\n| Button press | 100ms | ease-in | Tactile feedback |\n\n### Ambient Animation Timing\n\nAmbient animations create visual interest and brand atmosphere. They should be subtle enough to ignore but present enough to notice.\n\n| Animation | Duration | Use Case |\n|-----------|----------|----------|\n| Logo pulse | 2-3s | Subtle brand presence, hero sections |\n| Circuit signals | 3-5s | Data flow visualization, diagrams |\n| Infinite scroll | 20-25s | Logo carousels, social proof |\n| Plus Corner reveal | 150-200ms | Staggered entrance on card hover |\n\n### Framer Motion Patterns\n\n**Fade Up Entrance:**\n```tsx\nconst fadeUp = (delay: number) => ({\n  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  animate: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: {\n      duration: 0.15,\n      delay: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : delay,\n      ease: \"easeOut\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Staggered Children:**\n```tsx\nconst container = {\n  hidden: {},\n  visible: {\n    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 },\n  },\n};\n\nconst item = {\n  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  visible: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: { duration: 0.12, ease: \"easeOut\" },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### CSS Animations\n\n```css\n/* Subtle pulse for logos */\n@keyframes pulse-subtle {\n  0%, 100% {\n    opacity: 0.85;\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: scale(1.02);\n  }\n}\n\n.animate-pulse-slow {\n  animation: pulse-subtle 3s ease-in-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Infinite scroll for carousels */\n@keyframes scroll {\n  from { transform: translateX(0); }\n  to { transform: translateX(-50%); }\n}\n\n.animate-scroll {\n  animation: scroll linear infinite;\n}\n```\n\n### Reduced Motion\n\nAlways respect user preferences:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useReducedMotion } from \"framer-motion\";\n\nexport function AnimatedComponent() {\n  const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();\n\n  if (prefersReducedMotion) {\n    return <StaticVersion />;\n  }\n\n  return <AnimatedVersion />;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Dark Mode\n\n### Implementation\n\nDark mode is fully supported using Tailwind's dark variant and CSS custom properties.\n\n### Color Mapping\n\n| Element | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| Background | white (#FFFFFF) | black (#000000) |\n| Foreground text | black (#000000) | white (#FFFFFF) |\n| Muted text | zinc-500 (#71717A) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Label text | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) | zinc-500 (#71717A) |\n| Primary borders | black | white |\n| Dashed borders | zinc-200/zinc-300 | zinc-700/zinc-800 |\n| Plus corners | zinc-400 | zinc-600 |\n| Hover backgrounds | zinc-100 | zinc-800/zinc-900 |\n\n### Pattern\n\nAlways pair light and dark variants:\n\n```tsx\n// Text\nclassName=\"text-black dark:text-white\"\nclassName=\"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\"\n\n// Backgrounds\nclassName=\"bg-white dark:bg-black\"\nclassName=\"hover:bg-zinc-100 dark:hover:bg-zinc-800\"\n\n// Borders\nclassName=\"border-black dark:border-white\"\nclassName=\"border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nAccessibility is a core requirement, not an afterthought. Every component must be usable by everyone.\n\n### Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Standard | Implementation |\n|-------------|----------|----------------|\n| Color contrast | WCAG AA 4.5:1 | Black on white, high contrast palette |\n| Focus indicators | Visible 2px | Ring with offset on all interactives |\n| Keyboard navigation | Logical tab order | Semantic HTML, proper focus management |\n| Screen readers | ARIA labels | Native elements, aria-label where needed |\n| Motion sensitivity | prefers-reduced-motion | useReducedMotion hook |\n| Touch targets | 44×44px minimum | All interactive elements |\n\n### Contrast Ratios (Verified)\n\n| Combination | Ratio | Passes |\n|-------------|-------|--------|\n| Black (#000) on White (#FFF) | 21:1 | AAA ✓ |\n| White (#FFF) on Black (#000) | 21:1 | AAA ✓ |\n| zinc-500 (#71717A) on White | 4.6:1 | AA ✓ |\n| zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) on Black | 7.4:1 | AAA ✓ |\n| Emerald (#10B981) on White | 3.1:1 | Large text only |\n| Emerald (#10B981) on Black | 6.8:1 | AA ✓ |\n| Rose (#F43F5E) on White | 3.9:1 | Large text only |\n| Rose (#F43F5E) on Black | 5.4:1 | AA ✓ |\n\n**Note**: For accent colors that don't pass AA on white backgrounds, use with icons/large text, or pair with text labels.\n\n### Color Blindness Considerations\n\nThe accent palette is designed for distinguishability across color vision types:\n\n| Color | Protanopia | Deuteranopia | Tritanopia |\n|-------|------------|--------------|------------|\n| Emerald | Appears yellowish | Appears brownish | Distinct ✓ |\n| Violet | Distinct ✓ | Distinct ✓ | Appears pinkish |\n| Amber | Distinct ✓ | Distinct ✓ | Appears pinkish |\n| Rose | Appears dark | Appears brownish | Distinct ✓ |\n| Sky | Distinct ✓ | Distinct ✓ | Appears greenish |\n\n**Guidelines**:\n- Never rely on color alone to convey meaning\n- Always pair color with text labels, icons, or patterns\n- Use shape + color for status indicators (e.g., ✓ green, ✗ red)\n- Test with color blindness simulators before shipping\n\n### Cognitive Accessibility\n\n| Principle | Implementation |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| **Reduce complexity** | One primary action per view, clear hierarchy |\n| **Consistent patterns** | Same interactions work the same way everywhere |\n| **Clear feedback** | Every action has visible, immediate response |\n| **Forgiving input** | Allow corrections, confirm destructive actions |\n| **Scannable content** | Headlines, bullets, short paragraphs |\n\n### Focus States\n\n```tsx\nclassName=\"focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-black focus:ring-offset-2\"\n```\n\n### Screen Reader Considerations\n\n```tsx\n// Icon-only buttons\n<button aria-label=\"Toggle dark mode\">\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:moon\" />\n</button>\n\n// Decorative elements (Plus Corners, ambient graphics)\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" className=\"plus-corner\" />\n\n// Status with color\n<span className=\"text-emerald-500\">\n  <span className=\"sr-only\">Status: </span>\n  Complete ✓\n</span>\n```\n\n### Testing Checklist\n\nBefore shipping any feature:\n- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation works (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys)\n- [ ] Screen reader announces content correctly (test with VoiceOver/NVDA)\n- [ ] Color contrast passes WCAG AA (use browser DevTools audit)\n- [ ] Touch targets are 44×44px minimum\n- [ ] Reduced motion preference is respected\n- [ ] Focus is visible and logical\n- [ ] Color is not the only indicator of state\n\n---\n\n## Voice & Tone\n\n### Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Rational** | Facts over feelings, data over hype |\n| **Technical** | Precise language, no marketing fluff |\n| **Direct** | Say what you mean, no hedging |\n| **Authoritative** | Confident but not arrogant |\n\n### Writing Guidelines\n\n**Headlines:**\n- Active voice, present tense\n- Benefit-focused\n- 3-8 words optimal\n\n```\n✓ \"Know what needs to be done.\"\n✗ \"Our AI-powered platform helps you manage tasks.\"\n```\n\n**Error Messages:**\n- State the problem clearly\n- Provide actionable next steps\n- No cutesy language\n\n```\n✓ \"Failed to parse transcript. Check format and try again.\"\n✗ \"Oops! Something went wrong.

Built with Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and Framer Motion.\n\n## Design System\n\nRefer to `entourage_design_guide.md` for complete brand guidelines. Key principles:\n\n- **Digital Swiss Style**: Objectivity, precision, information density\n- **Typography**: Switzer (UI) + Geist Mono (code/data)\n- **Colors**: Functional only - black/white base, status colors for semantics\n- **Buttons**: Outline style preferred (black text, white background, border)\n- **Spacing**: 8px grid system\n\n## ShadCN UI Usage Guidelines\n\n### Core Principle: Never Modify ShadCN Components Directly\n\nWhen using ShadCN UI components:\n\n1. **Install with canary**: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>` (required for Tailwind v4)\n2. **Components go to `src/components/ui/`** - This is the default ShadCN location\n3. **NEVER modify files in `src/components/ui/`** - Treat these as read-only primitives\n4. **Create wrapper components in `src/components/`** for any customization\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx         # From: pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button\n│   ├── card.tsx\n│   └── ...\n├── Button.tsx             # Custom wrapper around ui/button\n├── Header.tsx             # App components\n├── Hero.tsx\n└── ...\n```\n\n### Creating Wrapper Components (React 19)\n\nWhen you need custom behavior or styling, create a wrapper using React 19 patterns:\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Button.tsx (Custom wrapper)\n// React 19: ref is a regular prop, no forwardRef needed\nimport { Button as ShadcnButton } from \"@/components/ui/button\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype ButtonProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnButton>;\n\nexport function Button({ className, variant = \"outline\", ...props }: ButtonProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnButton\n      variant={variant}\n      className={cn(\n        // Brand-aligned defaults\n        \"rounded-full\",\n        className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: React 19 deprecated `forwardRef`. Use `ComponentProps` for type inference instead.\n\n### Styling Customization Methods\n\n1. **CSS Variables** - For global theme changes in `globals.css`\n2. **className prop** - For one-off customizations via `cn()` utility\n3. **Wrapper components** - For reusable patterns (preferred)\n\n### Why This Pattern?\n\n- ShadCN updates won't break your customizations\n- Clear separation between library code and your code\n- Easy to upgrade: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component] --overwrite`\n- Consistent patterns across the codebase\n\n### When NOT to Create Wrappers\n\nAvoid over-abstraction. Don't create wrappers that just pass props through:\n\n```tsx\n// WRONG - pointless wrapper\nexport function Card(props: CardProps) {\n  return <ShadcnCard {...props} />;\n}\n\n// CORRECT - wrapper adds brand value\nexport function Card({ className, ...props }: CardProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnCard\n      className={cn(\"border-black shadow-none\", className)}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Component Guidelines\n\n### Button Variants (per Design Guide)\n\n- **Primary/Outline**: Black text, white bg, black border (default)\n- **Ghost**: Transparent bg, text only, subtle hover\n- **Success**: Green text + border (for completed actions)\n\n### Animation Guidelines\n\n- Use `useReducedMotion` hook for accessibility\n- Animations should inform, not entertain\n- Hover states: instant\n- Toggle/switch: 120ms ease-in-out\n- Page transitions: 150ms ease-out\n\n## Code Style\n\n- Use TypeScript for all components\n- React 19: No `forwardRef` needed, ref is a regular prop\n- Always destructure props with defaults\n- Use `cn()` utility for className merging\n- Use `ComponentProps<typeof Component>` for type inference\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":6,"oldLines":12,"newStart":6,"newLines":12,"lines":[" "," ## Design System"," ","-Refer to `entourage_design_guide.md` for complete brand guidelines.

Built with Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and Framer Motion.\n\n## Design System\n\nRefer to [`docs/design-system.md`](docs/design-system.md) for complete brand guidelines. Key principles:\n\n- **Technical Blueprint**: Sharp corners, precision, engineering-drawing aesthetic\n- **Typography**: Switzer (UI) + Geist Mono (code/data)\n- **Colors**: Black/white base + vibrant accent palette (Emerald, Violet, Amber, Rose, Sky)\n- **Plus Corners**: Signature brand element on featured containers\n- **Spacing**: 8px grid system\n\n## ShadCN UI Usage Guidelines\n\n### Core Principle: Never Modify ShadCN Components Directly\n\nWhen using ShadCN UI components:\n\n1. **Install with canary**: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>` (required for Tailwind v4)\n2. **Components go to `src/components/ui/`** - This is the default ShadCN location\n3. **NEVER modify files in `src/components/ui/`** - Treat these as read-only primitives\n4. **Create wrapper components in `src/components/`** for any customization\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx         # From: pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button\n│   ├── card.tsx\n│   └── ...\n├── Button.tsx             # Custom wrapper around ui/button\n├── Header.tsx             # App components\n├── Hero.tsx\n└── ...\n```\n\n### Creating Wrapper Components (React 19)\n\nWhen you need custom behavior or styling, create a wrapper using React 19 patterns:\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Button.tsx (Custom wrapper)\n// React 19: ref is a regular prop, no forwardRef needed\nimport { Button as ShadcnButton } from \"@/components/ui/button\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype ButtonProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnButton>;\n\nexport function Button({ className, variant = \"outline\", ...props }: ButtonProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnButton\n      variant={variant}\n      className={cn(\n        // Brand-aligned defaults\n        \"rounded-full\",\n        className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: React 19 deprecated `forwardRef`. Use `ComponentProps` for type inference instead.\n\n### Styling Customization Methods\n\n1. **CSS Variables** - For global theme changes in `globals.css`\n2. **className prop** - For one-off customizations via `cn()` utility\n3. **Wrapper components** - For reusable patterns (preferred)\n\n### Why This Pattern?\n\n- ShadCN updates won't break your customizations\n- Clear separation between library code and your code\n- Easy to upgrade: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component] --overwrite`\n- Consistent patterns across the codebase\n\n### When NOT to Create Wrappers\n\nAvoid over-abstraction. Don't create wrappers that just pass props through:\n\n```tsx\n// WRONG - pointless wrapper\nexport function Card(props: CardProps) {\n  return <ShadcnCard {...props} />;\n}\n\n// CORRECT - wrapper adds brand value\nexport function Card({ className, ...props }: CardProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnCard\n      className={cn(\"border-black shadow-none\", className)}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Component Guidelines\n\n### Button Variants (per Design Guide)\n\n- **Primary/Outline**: Black text, white bg, black border (default)\n- **Ghost**: Transparent bg, text only, subtle hover\n- **Success**: Green text + border (for completed actions)\n\n### Animation Guidelines\n\n- Use `useReducedMotion` hook for accessibility\n- Animations should inform, not entertain\n- Hover states: instant\n- Toggle/switch: 120ms ease-in-out\n- Page transitions: 150ms ease-out\n\n## Code Style\n\n- Use TypeScript for all components\n- React 19: No `forwardRef` needed, ref is a regular prop\n- Always destructure props with defaults\n- Use `cn()` utility for className merging\n- Use `ComponentProps<typeof Component>` for type inference\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":114,"oldLines":10,"newStart":114,"newLines":8,"lines":[" ### Animation Guidelines"," "," - Use `useReducedMotion` hook for accessibility","-- Animations should inform, not entertain","-- Hover states: instant","-- Toggle/switch: 120ms ease-in-out","-- Page transitions: 150ms ease-out","+- **UI animations**: Fast, functional (hover instant, transitions 100-150ms)","+- **Ambient animations**: Slow, atmospheric (logo pulse 2-3s, carousels 20-25s)"," "," ## Code Style"," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Built with Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and Framer Motion.\n\n## Design System\n\nRefer to [`docs/design-system.md`](docs/design-system.md) for complete brand guidelines. Key principles:\n\n- **Technical Blueprint**: Sharp corners, precision, engineering-drawing aesthetic\n- **Typography**: Switzer (UI) + Geist Mono (code/data)\n- **Colors**: Black/white base + vibrant accent palette (Emerald, Violet, Amber, Rose, Sky)\n- **Plus Corners**: Signature brand element on featured containers\n- **Spacing**: 8px grid system\n\n## ShadCN UI Usage Guidelines\n\n### Core Principle: Never Modify ShadCN Components Directly\n\nWhen using ShadCN UI components:\n\n1. **Install with canary**: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>` (required for Tailwind v4)\n2. **Components go to `src/components/ui/`** - This is the default ShadCN location\n3. **NEVER modify files in `src/components/ui/`** - Treat these as read-only primitives\n4. **Create wrapper components in `src/components/`** for any customization\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx         # From: pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button\n│   ├── card.tsx\n│   └── ...\n├── Button.tsx             # Custom wrapper around ui/button\n├── Header.tsx             # App components\n├── Hero.tsx\n└── ...\n```\n\n### Creating Wrapper Components (React 19)\n\nWhen you need custom behavior or styling, create a wrapper using React 19 patterns:\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Button.tsx (Custom wrapper)\n// React 19: ref is a regular prop, no forwardRef needed\nimport { Button as ShadcnButton } from \"@/components/ui/button\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype ButtonProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnButton>;\n\nexport function Button({ className, variant = \"outline\", ...props }: ButtonProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnButton\n      variant={variant}\n      className={cn(\n        // Brand-aligned defaults\n        \"rounded-full\",\n        className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: React 19 deprecated `forwardRef`. Use `ComponentProps` for type inference instead.\n\n### Styling Customization Methods\n\n1. **CSS Variables** - For global theme changes in `globals.css`\n2. **className prop** - For one-off customizations via `cn()` utility\n3. **Wrapper components** - For reusable patterns (preferred)\n\n### Why This Pattern?\n\n- ShadCN updates won't break your customizations\n- Clear separation between library code and your code\n- Easy to upgrade: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component] --overwrite`\n- Consistent patterns across the codebase\n\n### When NOT to Create Wrappers\n\nAvoid over-abstraction. Don't create wrappers that just pass props through:\n\n```tsx\n// WRONG - pointless wrapper\nexport function Card(props: CardProps) {\n  return <ShadcnCard {...props} />;\n}\n\n// CORRECT - wrapper adds brand value\nexport function Card({ className, ...props }: CardProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnCard\n      className={cn(\"border-black shadow-none\", className)}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Component Guidelines\n\n### Button Variants (per Design Guide)\n\n- **Primary/Outline**: Black text, white bg, black border (default)\n- **Ghost**: Transparent bg, text only, subtle hover\n- **Success**: Green text + border (for completed actions)\n\n### Animation Guidelines\n\n- Use `useReducedMotion` hook for accessibility\n- **UI animations**: Fast, functional (hover instant, transitions 100-150ms)\n- **Ambient animations**: Slow, atmospheric (logo pulse 2-3s, carousels 20-25s)\n\n## Code Style\n\n- Use TypeScript for all components\n- React 19: No `forwardRef` needed, ref is a regular prop\n- Always destructure props with defaults\n- Use `cn()` utility for className merging\n- Use `ComponentProps<typeof Component>` for type inference\n"}}

Don't create wrappers that just pass props through:\n+### Dark Mode\n \n+Always pair light/dark variants:\n ```tsx\n-// WRONG - pointless wrapper\n-export function Card(props: CardProps) {\n-  return <ShadcnCard {...props} />;\n-}\n+className=\"bg-white dark:bg-black text-black dark:text-white\"\n+```\n+\n+## ShadCN UI (When Adding Components)\n+\n+1. Install: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n+2. Components install to `src/components/ui/`\n+3. **Never modify ShadCN files directly**\n+4. Create wrapper components for brand customization\n+\n+Example wrapper:\n+```tsx\n+// src/components/Card.tsx\n+import { Card as ShadcnCard } from \"@/components/ui/card\";\n+import { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n \n-// CORRECT - wrapper adds brand value\n-export function Card({ className, ...props }: CardProps) {\n+export function Card({ className, ...props }) {\n   return (\n     <ShadcnCard\n-      className={cn(\"border-black shadow-none\", className)}\n+      className={cn(\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\", className)}\n       {...props}\n     />\n   );\n }\n ```\n \n-## Component Guidelines\n-\n-### Button Variants (per Design Guide)\n-\n-- **Primary/Outline**: Black text, white bg, black border (default)\n-- **Ghost**: Transparent bg, text only, subtle hover\n-- **Success**: Green text + border (for completed actions)\n+## Code Style\n \n-### Animation Guidelines\n+- TypeScript for all components\n+- React 19: No `forwardRef` needed, ref is a regular prop\n+- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n+- Use `ComponentProps<typeof X>` for type inference\n+- Destructure props with defaults\n \n-- Use `useReducedMotion` hook for accessibility\n-- Animations should inform, not entertain\n-- Hover states: instant\n-- Toggle/switch: 120ms ease-in-out\n-- Page transitions: 150ms ease-out\n+## Current Work\n \n-## Code Style\n+Branch: `feat/design-system`\n \n-- Use TypeScript for all components\n-- React 19: No `forwardRef` needed, ref is a regular prop\n-- Always destructure props with defaults\n-- Use `cn()` utility for className merging\n-- Use `ComponentProps<typeof Component>` for type inference\n+Landing page redesign in progress.

Don't create wrappers that just pass props through:\n+### Dark Mode\n \n+Always pair light/dark variants:\n ```tsx\n-// WRONG - pointless wrapper\n-export function Card(props: CardProps) {\n-  return <ShadcnCard {...props} />;\n-}\n+className=\"bg-white dark:bg-black text-black dark:text-white\"\n+```\n+\n+## ShadCN UI (When Adding Components)\n+\n+1. Install: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n+2. Components install to `src/components/ui/`\n+3. **Never modify ShadCN files directly**\n+4. Create wrapper components for brand customization\n+\n+Example wrapper:\n+```tsx\n+// src/components/Card.tsx\n+import { Card as ShadcnCard } from \"@/components/ui/card\";\n+import { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n \n-// CORRECT - wrapper adds brand value\n-export function Card({ className, ...props }: CardProps) {\n+export function Card({ className, ...props }) {\n   return (\n     <ShadcnCard\n-      className={cn(\"border-black shadow-none\", className)}\n+      className={cn(\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\", className)}\n       {...props}\n     />\n   );\n }\n ```\n \n-## Component Guidelines\n-\n-### Button Variants (per Design Guide)\n-\n-- **Primary/Outline**: Black text, white bg, black border (default)\n-- **Ghost**: Transparent bg, text only, subtle hover\n-- **Success**: Green text + border (for completed actions)\n+## Code Style\n \n-### Animation Guidelines\n+- TypeScript for all components\n+- React 19: No `forwardRef` needed, ref is a regular prop\n+- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n+- Use `ComponentProps<typeof X>` for type inference\n+- Destructure props with defaults\n \n-- Use `useReducedMotion` hook for accessibility\n-- Animations should inform, not entertain\n-- Hover states: instant\n-- Toggle/switch: 120ms ease-in-out\n-- Page transitions: 150ms ease-out\n+## Current Work\n \n-## Code Style\n+Branch: `feat/design-system`\n \n-- Use TypeScript for all components\n-- React 19: No `forwardRef` needed, ref is a regular prop\n-- Always destructure props with defaults\n-- Use `cn()` utility for className merging\n-- Use `ComponentProps<typeof Component>` for type inference\n+Landing page redesign in progress.
