Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n\n2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n\n   **For codebase research:**\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)\n   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to find examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.\n\n   **For thoughts directory:**\n   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic\n   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)\n\n   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n\n   **For Linear tickets (if relevant):**\n   - Use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details of a specific ticket\n   - Use the **linear-searcher** agent to find related tickets or historical context\n\n   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings to document how they work\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n   - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving\n\n4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/allison/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n\n5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**\n   - Run the `hack/spec_metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata\n   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n     - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n       - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n       - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic\n     - Examples:\n       - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n       - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`\n\n6. **Generate research document:**\n   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4\n   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n     ```markdown\n     ---\n     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]\n     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     git_commit: [Current commit hash]\n     branch: [Current branch name]\n     repository: [Repository name]\n     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n     status: complete\n     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]\n     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]\n     ---\n\n     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]\n     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]\n     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]\n     **Repository**: [Repository name]\n\n     ## Research Question\n     [Original user query]\n\n     ## Summary\n     [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]\n\n     ## Detailed Findings\n\n     ### [Component/Area 1]\n     - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))\n     - How it connects to other components\n     - Current implementation details (without evaluation)\n\n     ### [Component/Area 2]\n     ...\n\n     ## Code References\n     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there\n     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block\n\n     ## Architecture Documentation\n     [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]\n\n     ## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n     [Relevant insights from thoughts/ directory with references]\n     - `thoughts/shared/something.md` - Historical decision about X\n     - `thoughts/local/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y\n     Note: Paths exclude \"searchable/\" even if found there\n\n     ## Related Research\n     [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]\n\n     ## Open Questions\n     [Any areas that need further investigation]\n     ```\n\n7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**\n   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`\n   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:\n     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`\n     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`\n   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document\n\n8. **Sync and present findings:**\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the thoughts directory\n   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user\n   - Include key file references for easy navigation\n   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification\n\n9. **Handle follow-up questions:**\n   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document\n   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update\n   - Add `last_updated_note: \"Added follow-up research for [brief description]\"` to frontmatter\n   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`\n   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation\n   - Continue updating the document and syncing\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage\n- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents\n- The thoughts/ directory provides historical context to supplement live findings\n- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference\n- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context\n- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations\n- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact\n- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)\n- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references\n- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading\n- Have sub-agents document examples and usage patterns as they exist\n- Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory\n- **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators\n- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE\n- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase\n- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks\n- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly\n  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)\n  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)\n  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)\n  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values\n- **Path handling**: The thoughts/searchable/ directory contains hard links for searching\n  - Always document paths by removing ONLY \"searchable/\" - preserve all other subdirectories\n  - Examples of correct transformations:\n    - `thoughts/searchable/allison/old_stuff/notes.md` → `thoughts/allison/old_stuff/notes.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/shared/prs/123.md` → `thoughts/shared/prs/123.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/global/shared/templates.md` → `thoughts/global/shared/templates.md`\n  - NEVER change allison/ to shared/ or vice versa - preserve the exact directory structure\n  - This ensures paths are correct for editing and navigation\n- **Frontmatter consistency**:\n  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents\n  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents\n  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research\n  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)\n  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"286f94f2-7ace-47b6-8f9d-70c6cddf94c8","timestamp":"2025-12-27T14:01:07.783Z"}

The form redirects back to home on successful submission.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create Waitlist Page\n**File**: `src/app/waitlist/page.tsx` (new file)\n\n```tsx\nimport { WaitlistForm } from \"@/components/WaitlistForm\";\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\n\nexport default function WaitlistPage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n      <div className=\"w-full max-w-md text-center\">\n        <h1 className=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-black dark:text-white md:text-3xl\">\n          Join the Waitlist\n        </h1>\n        <p className=\"mt-2 text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n          Be the first to know when we launch.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"mt-8\">\n          <WaitlistForm />\n        </div>\n        <Link\n          href=\"/\"\n          className=\"mt-6 inline-block text-sm text-zinc-500 hover:text-black dark:text-zinc-400 dark:hover:text-white transition-colors\"\n        >\n          ← Back to home\n        </Link>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Update WaitlistForm to Redirect on Success\n**File**: `src/components/WaitlistForm.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add redirect to home after successful submission with a brief delay to show success message\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { useRouter } from \"next/navigation\";\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/Button\";\nimport { Input } from \"@/components/Input\";\nimport { Label } from \"@/components/Label\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\nexport function WaitlistForm() {\n  const router = useRouter();\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState(\"\");\n  const [name, setName] = useState(\"\");\n  const [status, setStatus] = useState<\"idle\" | \"loading\" | \"success\" | \"error\">(\n    \"idle\"\n  );\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"\");\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setStatus(\"loading\");\n    setMessage(\"\");\n\n    try {\n      const res = await fetch(\"/api/waitlist\", {\n        method: \"POST\",\n        headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n        body: JSON.stringify({ email, name: name || undefined }),\n      });\n\n      const data = await res.json();\n\n      if (res.ok) {\n        setStatus(\"success\");\n        setMessage(data.message);\n        setEmail(\"\");\n        setName(\"\");\n        // Redirect to home after showing success message\n        setTimeout(() => {\n          router.push(\"/?waitlist=success\");\n        }, 1500);\n      } else {\n        setStatus(\"error\");\n        setMessage(data.error || \"Something went wrong\");\n      }\n    } catch {\n      setStatus(\"error\");\n      setMessage(\"Failed to submit.

Update Hero CTA\n**File**: `src/components/sections/hero/Hero.tsx`\n**Changes**: Change link from `/sign-up` to `/waitlist`\n\n```tsx\n// Change from:\n<Link href=\"/sign-up\">\n\n// Change to:\n<Link href=\"/waitlist\">\n```\n\n#### 4. Update SecondaryCTA\n**File**: `src/components/sections/secondary-cta/SecondaryCTA.tsx`\n**Changes**: Change both link instances from `/sign-up` to `/waitlist`\n\n```tsx\n// Change both instances from:\n<Link href=\"/sign-up\">\n\n// Change to:\n<Link href=\"/waitlist\">\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] `/waitlist` route exists in build output\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] \"Join the Waitlist\" buttons navigate to `/waitlist` page\n- [ ] Waitlist page displays correctly with brand styling\n- [ ] Form submission works and shows success message\n- [ ] After success, user is redirected to home page\n- [ ] \"Back to home\" link works\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Click \"Login\" in header → should go to `/sign-in` page\n2. Click \"Join the Waitlist\" in Hero → should go to `/waitlist` page\n3. Click \"Join the Waitlist\" in SecondaryCTA → should go to `/waitlist` page\n4. On waitlist page, submit valid email → should show success and redirect to home\n5. Navigate to `/sign-up` → should show 404\n6. Complete sign-in flow → should redirect to dashboard\n\n## Files Changed Summary\n\n| Action | File |\n|--------|------|\n| Modify | `src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx` |\n| Delete | `src/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx` |\n| Modify | `src/proxy.ts` |\n| Modify | `.env.example` |\n| Create | `src/app/waitlist/page.tsx` |\n| Modify | `src/components/WaitlistForm.tsx` |\n| Modify | `src/components/sections/hero/Hero.tsx` |\n| Modify | `src/components/sections/secondary-cta/SecondaryCTA.tsx` |\n","numLines":339,"startLine":1,"totalLines":339}}}

The system features a distinctive **Plus Corner** motif as its signature brand element.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n| Principle | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Objectivity** | Information over emotion. Let the data speak. |\n| **Precision** | Grid-based layouts, consistent spacing, sharp corners. |\n| **Clarity** | High contrast, readable typography, functional color. |\n| **Density** | Information-rich interfaces that respect the user's time. |\n| **Intentionality** | Every element has purpose. Brand elements (Plus Corners) create consistency; UI elements enable action. |\n\n### Design Inspiration\n\n| Source | What We Borrow |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Engineering drawings** | Sharp corners, measurement markers, construction guides |\n| **Vercel** | Technical precision, developer focus |\n| **Linear** | Dense information display, keyboard-first, monospace accents |\n\n### The Technical Blueprint Aesthetic\n\nThink of Entourage's interface as a technical drawing:\n- Sharp corners (0px radius everywhere)\n- Dashed/dotted borders as construction guides\n- Plus signs (+) as signature corner markers\n- Monospace text for data and labels\n- High contrast black/white with a vibrant accent palette\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n| Category | Technology |\n|----------|------------|\n| Framework | Next.js 16, React 19 |\n| Components | ShadcnUI (base) → Custom wrappers |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |\n| Animation | Framer Motion |\n| Icons | Iconify (Lucide primary, Simple Icons for brands) |\n| Fonts | Switzer (UI), Geist Mono (code/data) |\n\n---\n\n## Color System\n\n### Design Methodology\n\nColors are **functional signals**, not decoration. We use a strictly monochromatic base with semantic colors for status only.\n\n### Primary Palette: Monochrome\n\n```css\n/* Core — Brand foundation */\n--color-black:       #000000;   /* Primary text, borders (light mode) */\n--color-white:       #FFFFFF;   /* Backgrounds (light mode) */\n```\n\n### Gray Scale (Zinc)\n\n| Token | Hex | Light Mode Use | Dark Mode Use |\n|-------|-----|----------------|---------------|\n| **zinc-50** | #FAFAFA | Subtle backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-100** | #F4F4F5 | Section backgrounds | — |\n| **zinc-200** | #E4E4E7 | Dashed borders | — |\n| **zinc-300** | #D4D4D8 | Dotted borders, input borders | — |\n| **zinc-400** | #A1A1AA | Plus corners, labels | — |\n| **zinc-500** | #71717A | Muted text | Body text |\n| **zinc-600** | #52525B | — | Plus corners |\n| **zinc-700** | #3F3F46 | — | Dotted borders |\n| **zinc-800** | #27272A | — | Dashed borders |\n| **zinc-900** | #18181B | — | Backgrounds |\n\n### Accent Palette\n\nEntourage uses a vibrant, distinguishable accent palette for both brand expression and color coding within the service. These colors are carefully chosen to be visually distinct from each other and accessible on both light and dark backgrounds.\n\n| Color | Hex | Tailwind | Primary Use |\n|-------|-----|----------|-------------|\n| **Emerald** | #10B981 | emerald-500 | Primary accent, success, AI actions, active states |\n| **Violet** | #8B5CF6 | violet-500 | Categories, tags, special elements |\n| **Amber** | #F59E0B | amber-500 | Warnings, attention, pending states |\n| **Rose** | #F43F5E | rose-500 | Errors, destructive actions, urgent |\n| **Sky** | #0EA5E9 | sky-500 | Information, links, secondary actions |\n\n### Semantic Mapping\n\nColors serve double duty: brand expression AND functional meaning.\n\n| Semantic | Color | Use Cases |\n|----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Success** | Emerald | Completed tasks, active status, confirmations |\n| **AI/Processing** | Emerald | AI-powered features, processing indicators |\n| **Warning** | Amber | Pending review, attention needed |\n| **Error** | Rose | Failed actions, validation errors |\n| **Info** | Sky | Informational messages, links |\n| **Special** | Violet | Tags, categories, premium features |\n\n### Color Coding Guidelines\n\nWhen using colors for categorization or tagging:\n- Use the full palette for maximum distinction\n- Pair color with text labels for accessibility\n- Maintain consistent meaning across the product\n- Use 10% opacity backgrounds with full-color text/borders\n\n### Color Pairing Rules\n\n| Context | Background | Text | Border | Hover BG |\n|---------|------------|------|--------|----------|\n| **Page (light)** | white | black | — | — |\n| **Page (dark)** | black | white | — | — |\n| **Card (light)** | white | black | black or zinc-300 | zinc-50 |\n| **Card (dark)** | black | white | white or zinc-700 | zinc-900 |\n| **Primary Button** | white | black | black | zinc-100 |\n| **Solid Button** | black | white | black | zinc-800 |\n| **Muted Text (light)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Muted Text (dark)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Labels (dark)** | — | zinc-500 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (light)** | — | zinc-400 | — | — |\n| **Plus Corners (dark)** | — | zinc-600 | — | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (light)** | — | — | zinc-200 | — |\n| **Dashed Frames (dark)** | — | — | zinc-800 | — |\n\n### Color Application Rules\n\n1. **Never use color decoratively** — Every color must have semantic meaning\n2. **Pair color with context** — A colored element alone isn't enough; add text or icon\n3. **Use tints for backgrounds** — Full color for text/borders, 10% opacity for backgrounds\n4. **Maintain contrast** — All text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)\n\n### CSS Variables (globals.css)\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode */\n  --background: #FFFFFF;\n  --foreground: #171717;\n  --card: #FFFFFF;\n  --card-foreground: #171717;\n  --primary: #171717;\n

|\n| Labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-wider (0.05em) |\n| Uppercase labels | leading-normal (1.5) | tracking-widest (0.1em) |\n\n---\n\n## Spacing & Layout\n\n### Base Unit: 8px Grid\n\nAll spacing snaps to an 8px grid.\n\n| Unit | Pixels | Tailwind | Use |\n|------|--------|----------|-----|\n| 0.5 | 2px | 0.5 | Micro adjustments |\n| 1 | 4px | 1 | Tight inline gaps |\n| 2 | 8px | 2 | Standard padding, icon gaps |\n| 3 | 12px | 3 | Small component gaps |\n| 4 | 16px | 4 | Component padding, margins |\n| 6 | 24px | 6 | Section inner padding |\n| 8 | 32px | 8 | Component margins |\n| 12 | 48px | 12 | Section gaps |\n| 16 | 64px | 16 | Large section padding |\n| 24 | 96px | 24 | Hero spacing |\n\n### Container\n\n```tsx\n<div className=\"mx-auto w-full max-w-5xl px-6 md:px-12\">\n  {children}\n</div>\n```\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Maximum width | 1024px (max-w-5xl) |\n| Horizontal padding (mobile) | 24px (px-6) |\n| Horizontal padding (desktop) | 48px (md:px-12) |\n\n### Section Padding\n\n| Pattern | Class | Use |\n|---------|-------|-----|\n| **Hero** | `pt-28 pb-16 sm:pt-32 sm:pb-24 md:pt-40 md:pb-32` | First section with nav offset |\n| **Standard** | `py-16 md:py-24` | Most content sections |\n| **Compact** | `py-12 md:py-16` | Secondary sections |\n| **Footer** | `py-8` | Footer content |\n\n### Responsive Breakpoints\n\n| Breakpoint | Width | Prefix |\n|------------|-------|--------|\n| Mobile | < 640px | (default) |\n| Small | ≥ 640px | sm: |\n| Medium | ≥ 768px | md: |\n| Large | ≥ 1024px | lg: |\n| XL | ≥ 1280px | xl: |\n\n---\n\n## Shadow System\n\n### Philosophy\n\nShadows in Entourage are **minimal and purposeful**. The blueprint aesthetic favors flat design, but subtle shadows can indicate elevation when needed.\n\n### Shadow Tokens\n\n```css\n/* Light mode shadows */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n\n/* Dark mode shadows (deeper, less visible) */\n--shadow-card-dark: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n--shadow-card-hover-dark: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n--shadow-lg-dark: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\n### Shadow Usage\n\n| Element | Shadow | Use Case |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Buttons** | none | Flat by default (use borders) |\n| **Cards at rest** | shadow-sm or none | Minimal elevation |\n| **Cards on hover** | shadow-card-hover | Subtle lift effect |\n| **Dropdowns** | shadow-lg | Floating above content |\n| **Modals** | shadow-xl | Highest elevation |\n| **Toasts** | shadow-lg | Notification prominence |\n\n### When to Use Shadows\n\n**Use shadows for:**\n- Floating elements (dropdowns, popovers, modals)\n- Interactive card hover states\n- Toast notifications\n\n**Avoid shadows on:**\n- Static cards (prefer borders)\n- Buttons (use border states)\n- Navigation elements\n- Within the main content flow\n\n---\n\n## Plus Corner System\n\n### Concept\n\nThe Plus Corner is Entourage's **signature decorative element** — four plus signs (+) that mark the corners of featured containers. This is derived from technical blueprints where plus marks indicate measurement points.\n\n```\n   +───────────────────────────+\n   ╎                           ╎\n   ╎     Content Area          ╎\n   ╎                           ╎\n   +───────────────────────────+\n```\n\n### Plus Corner Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Specifications\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| Size | 20px × 20px (w-5 h-5) |\n| Position offset | 10px from corner (-top-2.5 -left-2.5) |\n| Stroke width | 1px |\n| Color (light) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Color (dark) | zinc-600 (#52525B) |\n\n### Opacity Tiers\n\nThree-tier system for consistent application:\n\n| Tier | Opacity | Use Case |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| **Subtle** | 50% (opacity-50) | Background decoration, static frames |\n| **Default** | 100% | Standard cards, featured sections |\n| **Emphasis** | 100% + scale | Hover states with slight grow effect |\n\n### Animation (Staggered Reveal)\n\nFor enhanced interactivity, Plus Corners can animate in with a stagger effect:\n\n```css\n.plus-corner {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.8);\n  transition:\n    opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1),\n    transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n}\n\n/* Stagger delays */\n.plus-corner--tl { transition-delay: 0ms; }\n.plus-corner--tr { transition-delay: 50ms; }\n.plus-corner--bl { transition-delay: 100ms; }\n.plus-corner--br { transition-delay: 150ms; }\n\n/* Visible state */\n.group:hover .plus-corner {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1);\n}\n\n/* Reduced motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .plus-corner {\n    transition: opacity 0ms;\n    transform: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Hover Enhancement (Optional)\n\nFor interactive cards, Plus Corners can subtly shift color on hover:\n\n```tsx\n<PlusCorner\n  className={cn(\n    \"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5\",\n    \"text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    \"transition-colors duration-150\",\n    \"group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\n### Full Implementation\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={className}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function PlusCornerCard({\n  children,\n  className,\n  dashed = true,\n  interactive = false\n}: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  const cornerClass = cn(\n    \"absolute w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\",\n    interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn(\n        \"group relative\",\n        dashed\n          ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n          : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n        \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n        className\n      )}\n    >\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-top-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -left-2.5\")} />\n      <PlusCorner className={cn(cornerClass, \"-bottom-2.5 -right-2.5\")} />\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### SVG Implementation (Embedded Graphics)\n\nWhen Plus Corners appear inside an SVG:\n\n```svg\n<g class=\"stroke-zinc-400 dark:stroke-zinc-600\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\">\n  <!-- Plus at position (x, y) with 5px arms -->\n  <path d=\"M x y-5 v 10 M x-5 y h 10\" />\n</g>\n```\n\n### Exclusion List (When NOT to Use)\n\nDo **not** apply Plus Corners to:\n\n| Element | Reason |\n|---------|--------|\n| Body text/paragraphs | Decorative noise |\n| Icons | Too small, cluttered |\n| Inline links | Disrupts reading flow |\n| Buttons | Use border states instead |\n| Navigation items | Use underline/color |\n| Toast notifications | Keep minimal |\n| Tooltips | Too small |\n| Very small components (< 80px) | Corners overwhelm content |\n| Footer | Keep simple |\n| Form inputs | Use focus states |\n\n### Application Contexts\n\n| Element | Plus Corners | Style |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **Hero section** | Yes | Dashed border + corners |\n| **Feature cards** | Yes | Dashed or solid |\n| **Bento grid items** | Yes | Default opacity |\n| **Images/media frames** | Yes, subtle | 50% opacity |\n| **Section dividers** | Optional | At endpoints only |\n| **Buttons** | No | — |\n| **Inputs** | No | — |\n\n---\n\n## Borders & Dividers\n\n### Border Styles\n\n| Type | Class | Use |\n|------|-------|-----|\n| **Solid** | `border` | Cards, buttons, primary containers |\n| **Dashed** | `border-dashed` | Featured frames, hero sections |\n| **Dotted** | `border-dotted` or SVG | Embedded graphics, construction guides |\n\n### Border Colors\n\n| Context | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| **Primary borders** | border-black | border-white |\n| **Card borders** | border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 |\n| **Dashed frames** | border-zinc-200 or border-zinc-300 | border-zinc-700 or border-zinc-800 |\n| **Subtle dividers** | border-zinc-200 | border-zinc-800 |\n\n### Border Width\n\n| Width | Class | Use |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| 1px | border | Standard borders |\n| 2px | border-2 | Emphasis, focus states |\n\n---\n\n## Components (ShadcnUI Patterns)\n\n### Component Wrapper Philosophy\n\n**Never edit ShadcnUI components directly.** Create wrapper components that apply brand styling.\n\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── ui/                    # ShadcnUI primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── button.tsx         # Raw ShadcnUI\n│   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   └── ...\n├── Button.tsx             # Entourage wrapper (CUSTOMIZE HERE)\n├── Dialog.tsx             # Entourage wrapper\n└── ...\n```\n\n### Button\n\n**Base:** Custom implementation following Entourage brand.\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/ui/Button.tsx\nimport { ButtonHTMLAttributes, ReactNode } from \"react\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport { Loader2 } from \"lucide-react\";\n\ninterface ButtonProps extends ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {\n  children: ReactNode;\n  variant?: \"primary\" | \"solid\" |

min-w-[44px]\",\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      className={cn(baseStyles, variants[variant], sizes[size], className)}\n      disabled={disabled || loading}\n      {...props}\n    >\n      {loading && <Loader2 className=\"mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin\" />}\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button States:**\n\n| State | Visual |\n|-------|--------|\n| Default | As specified by variant |\n| Hover | Background shifts (zinc-100/zinc-800) |\n| Focus | 2px black ring with offset |\n| Disabled | 50% opacity, not-allowed cursor |\n| Loading | Spinner icon, disabled state |\n\n**Button Usage:**\n\n| Context | Recommended Variant |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| Primary CTA (Join Waitlist) | solid |\n| Header navigation | secondary |\n| Card actions |

*/}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Table Skeleton:**\n\n```tsx\nexport function TableSkeleton({ rows = 5 }: { rows?: number }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white\">\n      <div className=\"border-b border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 p-4\">\n        <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-32\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-24\" />\n          <Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-20\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      {[...Array(rows)].map((_, i) => (\n        <div key={i} className=\"border-b

justify-center min-h-[400px]\">\n      <Loader size=\"lg\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Next.js Loading Patterns\n\n**Route-level loading (loading.tsx):**\n\n```tsx\n// app/dashboard/loading.tsx\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nexport default function Loading() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-16\">\n      <div

);\n}\n```\n\n**Component-level with Suspense:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { Suspense } from \"react\";\nimport { CardSkeleton } from \"@/components/Skeleton\";\n\nasync function TaskCards() {\n  const tasks = await fetchTasks();\n  return tasks.map(task => <TaskCard key={task.id} task={task} />);\n}\n\nexport default function DashboardPage() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton />}>\n      <TaskCards />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Button loading state:**\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/Button\";\n\nexport function SubmitButton() {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async () => {\n    setLoading(true);\n    await submitForm();\n    setLoading(false);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Button loading={loading} onClick={handleSubmit}>\n      {loading ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cards & Containers\n\n### Card Types\n\n| Type | Border | Background | Plus Corners | Use |\n|------|--------|------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Primary Card** | border-black | bg-white | No | Main containers |\n| **Featured Frame** | border-dashed border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Hero, highlights |\n| **Bento Card** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | Yes | Grid layouts |\n| **Input/Badge** | border-zinc-300 | bg-white | No | Form elements |\n\n### Card Patterns\n\n**Primary Card:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"border border-black dark:border-white bg-white dark:bg-black p-4\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</div>\n```\n\n**Featured Frame with Plus Corners:**\n```tsx\n<PlusCornerCard className=\"p-6 md:p-12\">\n  {/* Content */}\n</PlusCornerCard>\n```\n\n**Icon Container:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex h-12 w-12 items-center justify-center border border-black dark:border-white\">\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:check\" size={24} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Icons\n\n### Icon System: Iconify\n\nWe use Iconify for access to 200,000+ open source icons.\n\n#### Recommended Sets\n\n| Set | Prefix | Use Case |\n|-----|--------|----------|\n| **Lucide** | lucide: | Primary UI icons |\n| **Simple Icons** | simple-icons: | Brand/product logos |\n| **MDI** | mdi: | Additional coverage |\n| **Line-MD** | line-md: | Animated icons |\n\n#### Icon Component\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/Icon.tsx\nimport { Icon as IconifyIcon } from \"@iconify-icon/react\";\n\ninterface IconProps {\n  icon: string;\n  size?: number;\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nexport function Icon({ icon, size = 24, className }: IconProps) {\n  return (\n    <IconifyIcon\n      icon={icon}\n      width={size}\n      height={size}\n      className={className}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Icon Sizes\n\n| Context | Size | Example |\n|---------|------|---------|\n| Inline with text | 16-18px | Menu items |\n| Card icons | 20-24px | Feature cards |\n| Featured icons | 24-32px | Hero elements |\n| Logo size | 32-48px | Header |\n\n#### Icon Colors\n\nIcons inherit text color:\n- `text-black dark:text-white` — Primary icons\n- `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` — Muted icons\n- Status colors for semantic icons\n\n---\n\n## Animation & Motion\n\n### Philosophy\n\nEntourage uses two distinct animation categories:\n\n1. **UI Animations** — Fast, functional, inform the user about state changes. These should feel instant and purposeful.\n2. **Ambient Animations** — Slow, atmospheric, create brand presence. These run in the background and establish visual rhythm without demanding attention.\n\nUI animations prioritize clarity. Ambient animations prioritize feel.\n\n### UI Animation Timing\n\n| Interaction | Duration | Easing | Purpose |\n|-------------|----------|--------|---------|\n| Hover state | Instant | — | Immediate feedback |\n| Color transitions | 150ms | ease-out | Smooth visual change |\n| Toggle/switch | 120ms | ease-in-out | Clear state change |\n| Page transition | 150ms | ease-out | Visual continuity |\n| Scroll reveal | 120ms | ease-out | Content appearance |\n| Button press | 100ms | ease-in | Tactile feedback |\n\n### Ambient Animation Timing\n\nAmbient animations create visual interest and brand atmosphere. They should be subtle enough to ignore but present enough to notice.\n\n| Animation | Duration | Use Case |\n|-----------|----------|----------|\n| Logo pulse | 2-3s | Subtle brand presence, hero sections |\n| Circuit signals | 3-5s | Data flow visualization, diagrams |\n| Infinite scroll | 20-25s | Logo carousels, social proof |\n| Plus Corner reveal | 150-200ms | Staggered entrance on card hover |\n\n### Framer Motion Patterns\n\n**Fade Up Entrance:**\n```tsx\nconst fadeUp = (delay: number) => ({\n  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  animate: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: {\n      duration: 0.15,\n      delay: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : delay,\n      ease: \"easeOut\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Staggered Children:**\n```tsx\nconst container = {\n  hidden: {},\n  visible: {\n    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 },\n  },\n};\n\nconst item = {\n  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  visible: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: { duration: 0.12, ease: \"easeOut\" },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### CSS Animations\n\n```css\n/* Subtle pulse for logos */\n@keyframes pulse-subtle {\n  0%, 100% {\n    opacity: 0.85;\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: scale(1.02);\n  }\n}\n\n.animate-pulse-slow {\n  animation: pulse-subtle 3s ease-in-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Infinite scroll for carousels */\n@keyframes scroll {\n  from { transform: translateX(0); }\n  to { transform: translateX(-50%); }\n}\n\n.animate-scroll {\n  animation: scroll linear infinite;\n}\n```\n\n### Reduced Motion\n\nAlways respect user preferences:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useReducedMotion } from \"framer-motion\";\n\nexport function AnimatedComponent() {\n  const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();\n\n  if (prefersReducedMotion) {\n    return <StaticVersion />;\n  }\n\n  return <AnimatedVersion />;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Dark Mode\n\n### Implementation\n\nDark mode is fully supported using Tailwind's dark variant and CSS custom properties.\n\n### Color Mapping\n\n| Element | Light Mode | Dark Mode |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| Background | white (#FFFFFF) | black (#000000) |\n| Foreground text | black (#000000) | white (#FFFFFF) |\n| Muted text | zinc-500 (#71717A) | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) |\n| Label text | zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) | zinc-500 (#71717A) |\n| Primary borders | black | white |\n| Dashed borders | zinc-200/zinc-300 | zinc-700/zinc-800 |\n| Plus corners | zinc-400 | zinc-600 |\n| Hover backgrounds | zinc-100 | zinc-800/zinc-900 |\n\n### Pattern\n\nAlways pair light and dark variants:\n\n```tsx\n// Text\nclassName=\"text-black dark:text-white\"\nclassName=\"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\"\n\n// Backgrounds\nclassName=\"bg-white dark:bg-black\"\nclassName=\"hover:bg-zinc-100 dark:hover:bg-zinc-800\"\n\n// Borders\nclassName=\"border-black dark:border-white\"\nclassName=\"border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nAccessibility is a core requirement, not an afterthought.

The configuration follows the \"Technical Blueprint\" aesthetic with sharp corners, no border radius, and precise color mappings for both light and dark modes.\n\n---\n\n## 1. ClerkProvider Configuration\n\n### Location: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/layout.tsx`\n\n#### Provider Wrapper (Lines 39-60)\nClerkProvider wraps the entire application outside of the `<html>` tag but inside the RootLayout component. It contains ThemeProvider as a child.\n\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    variables: { ... },\n    elements: { ... }\n  }}\n>\n  <html lang=\"en\" suppressHydrationWarning>\n    <body>\n      <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>\n    </body>\n  </html>\n</ClerkProvider>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Appearance Configuration\n\n### Variables Configuration (Lines 41-48)\n\nCustom CSS variables passed to Clerk's appearance API:\n\n| Variable | Value | Purpose |\n|----------|-------|---------|\n| `colorPrimary` | `#10B981` | Emerald accent (design system primary) |\n| `colorDanger` | `#F43F5E` | Rose error color |\n| `colorSuccess` | `#10B981` | Emerald success (matches primary) |\n| `colorWarning` | `#F59E0B` | Amber warning |\n| `borderRadius` | `0rem` | Sharp corners (no radius) |\n| `fontFamily` | `\"Switzer\", -apple-system, sans-serif` | Brand font Switzer |\n\n### Elements Configuration (Lines 49-58)\n\nDirect className strings applied to specific Clerk UI elements:\n\n#### Primary Button (Line 50-51)\n```tsx\nformButtonPrimary: \"bg-black dark:bg-white text-white dark:text-black border border-black dark:border-white rounded-none hover:bg-zinc-800 dark:hover:bg-zinc-100 transition-colors\"\n```\n- Light mode: Black background, white text\n- Dark mode: White background, black text\n- Always has border matching background\n- Subtle hover states (zinc-800/zinc-100)\n\n#### Card Container (Line 52)\n```tsx\ncard: \"bg-white dark:bg-black border border-black dark:border-white rounded-none shadow-none\"\n```\n- Matches page background colors\n- High-contrast borders (black/white)\n- No shadows (flat design)\n\n#### Header Elements (Lines 53-54)\n```tsx\nheaderTitle: \"text-black dark:text-white font-semibold\"\nheaderSubtitle: \"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\"\n```\n- Title: High contrast, semibold weight\n- Subtitle: Muted text per design system\n\n#### Form Inputs (Lines 55-56)\n```tsx\nformFieldInput: \"rounded-none border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-white dark:bg-black\"\n```\n- No border radius\n- Softer border colors (zinc-300/zinc-700) than card borders\n- Matches page background\n\n#### Footer Links (Line 57)\n```tsx\nfooterActionLink: \"text-emerald-500 hover:text-emerald-600\"\n```\n- Emerald accent for links (matches colorPrimary)\n- Subtle hover darkening\n\n---\n\n## 3. Global CSS Configuration\n\n### Location: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/globals.css`\n\n#### CSS Layer Declaration (Line 1)\n```css\n@layer theme, base, clerk, components, utilities;\n```\nThe `clerk` layer is defined but **no custom CSS targeting Clerk components is present** in globals.css. All Clerk styling is handled via the `appearance` prop in layout.tsx.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Clerk Component Usage\n\n### Header Integration\n**Location**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx`\n\n#### Imports (Line 6)\n```tsx\nimport { SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\n```\n\n#### Signed-Out State (Lines 53-59)\n```tsx\n<SignedOut>\n  <Link href=\"/sign-in\">\n    <Button variant=\"secondary\" size=\"default\">\n      Login\n    </Button>\n  </Link>\n</SignedOut>\n```\nShows a \"Login\" button linking to `/sign-in` when user is not authenticated.\n\n#### Signed-In State (Lines 60-62)\n```tsx\n<SignedIn>\n  <UserButton afterSignOutUrl=\"/\" />\n</SignedIn>\n```\nShows Clerk's UserButton component. After sign-out, redirects to homepage (`/`).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Sign-In Page\n\n### Location: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`\n\n#### Implementation (Lines 1-9)\n```tsx\nimport { SignIn } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n      <SignIn />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n- Uses Clerk's catch-all route pattern `[[...sign-in]]`\n- Centers the SignIn component vertically and horizontally\n- Matches page background colors (white/black)\n- No additional styling—inherits from ClerkProvider appearance config\n\n---\n\n## 6. Dashboard Protection\n\n### Location: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`\n\n#### Auth Check (Lines 4-9)\n```tsx\nconst { userId } = await auth();\n\nif (!userId) {\n  redirect(\"/sign-in\");\n}\n```\nServer-side authentication check using Clerk's `auth()` helper. Redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in page.\n\n#### User Data Fetch (Line 11)\n```tsx\nconst user = await currentUser();\n```\nFetches current user data from Clerk for display.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Environment Variables\n\n### Location: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/.env.example`\n\n#### Required Variables (Lines 1-5)\n```env\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\nCLERK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard\n```\n\n| Variable | Visibility | Purpose |\n|----------|-----------|---------|\n| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Public | Client-side Clerk initialization |\n| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Private | Server-side API authentication |\n| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` | Public | Custom sign-in route path |\n| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL` | Public | Redirect after successful sign-in |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Package Dependencies\n\n### Location: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/package.json`\n\n#### Clerk Package (Line 19)\n```json\n\"@clerk/nextjs\": \"^6.36.5\"\n```\nNo additional Clerk packages installed. The project does **not** use `@clerk/themes` package—all theming is done via the `appearance` prop.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Middleware Configuration\n\n### Status\n**No middleware.ts file exists** in the project root or `src/` directory. \n\nAccording to the integration plan (`thoughts/shared/plans/2025-12-27-clerk-supabase-resend-integration.md` line 36), the project was intended to use `src/proxy.ts` for Next.js 16, but no such file currently exists in the codebase.\n\nRoute protection is handled via server-side `auth()` checks in individual page components (e.g., dashboard/page.tsx) rather than middleware.\n\n---\n\n## Summary: How Clerk Styling Works\n\n### Configuration Method\nAll Clerk styling is configured through the **`appearance` prop** on ClerkProvider in `layout.tsx`. No CSS overrides are used.\n\n### Design System Alignment\n| Design Element | Clerk Implementation |\n|----------------|---------------------|\n| Sharp corners | `borderRadius: \"0rem\"` + `rounded-none` classes |\n| High contrast borders | `border-black dark:border-white` on cards/buttons |\n| Emerald accent | `colorPrimary: \"#10B981\"` |\n| Switzer font | `fontFamily: \"Switzer\"` variable |\n| Flat design | `shadow-none` on cards |\n| Dark mode | All elements have `dark:` variants |\n\n### Key Pattern\nThe configuration uses Clerk's built-in theming system rather than external theme packages or CSS overrides. This approach:\n1. Applies brand colors via the `variables` object\n2. Applies Tailwind classes directly via the `elements` object\n3. Ensures consistency with the rest of the application's design system\n4.

Now let me compile a comprehensive guide with concrete code examples for your use case.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've researched Clerk's authentication component customization system. Here's a comprehensive guide to matching Clerk components to your black/white/zinc design system with sharp corners.\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1. ClerkProvider Appearance Prop Structure\n\n**Source**: [Clerk Appearance Prop Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/overview)\n\n**Relevance**: The `appearance` prop is the main customization interface. It can be applied globally to `<ClerkProvider>` or to individual components like `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />`.\n\n**Key Structure**:\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    baseTheme: undefined,     // Optional preset theme\n    variables: {},            // General styles (colors, fonts, spacing)\n    elements: {},             // Fine-grained element styling\n    layout: {}                // Logo, terms links, etc.\n  }}\n>\n  {children}\n</ClerkProvider>\n```\n\n### 2. Available CSS Variables for Your Design System\n\n**Source**: [Clerk Variables Prop Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/variables)\n\n**Relevance**: These variables control the core visual properties that define your brand identity.\n\n**Complete Variable List for Black/White/Zinc Theme**:\n\n```tsx\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider\n      appearance={{\n        variables: {\n          // Colors - Black/White/Zinc palette\n          colorPrimary: '#000000',              // Primary actions (black)\n          colorForeground: '#000000',           // Primary text (black)\n          colorBackground: '#ffffff',           // Card background (white)\n          colorNeutral: '#71717a',              // Zinc-500 for neutral elements\n          colorMutedForeground: '#a1a1aa',      // Zinc-400 for muted text\n          \n          // Input fields\n          colorInputBackground: '#ffffff',      // White input backgrounds\n          colorInputForeground: '#000000',      // Black input text\n          \n          // State colors (can use your accent palette)\n          colorDanger: '#f43f5e',               // Rose for errors\n          colorSuccess: '#10b981',              // Emerald for success\n          colorWarning: '#f59e0b',              // Amber for warnings\n          \n          // Typography\n          fontFamily: 'Switzer, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif',\n          fontSize: '0.875rem',                 // 14px base\n          fontWeight: {\n            normal: 400,\n            medium: 500,\n            semibold: 600,\n            bold: 700,\n          },\n          \n          // Sharp corners - CRITICAL for your design\n          borderRadius: '0px',                  // NO border radius\n          \n          // Spacing\n          spacing: '1rem',                      // 16px spacing unit\n        },\n      }}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**CSS Variable Names**: All appearance variables are also available as CSS custom properties with the `--clerk-` prefix in kebab-case:\n- `colorPrimary` → `--clerk-color-primary`\n- `borderRadius` → `--clerk-border-radius`\n- `fontFamily` → `--clerk-font-family`\n\n### 3. Using CSS Variables Directly in Stylesheets\n\n**Source**: [Clerk CSS Variables Support](https://clerk.com/changelog/2025-07-15-clerk-css-variables-support)\n\n**Relevance**: As of July 2025, you can now define Clerk variables in your CSS instead of JavaScript, which integrates better with existing design systems.\n\n**Implementation in globals.css**:\n\n```css\n/* In your src/app/globals.css */\n:root {\n  /* Clerk theme variables - Light mode */\n  --clerk-color-primary: #000000;\n  --clerk-color-foreground: #000000;\n  --clerk-color-background: #ffffff;\n  --clerk-color-neutral: #71717a;  /* zinc-500 */\n  --clerk-border-radius: 0px;\n  --clerk-font-family: 'Switzer', -apple-system, sans-serif;\n}\n\n.dark {\n  /* Dark mode overrides */\n  --clerk-color-primary: #ffffff;\n  --clerk-color-foreground: #ffffff;\n  --clerk-color-background: #000000;\n  --clerk-color-neutral: #a1a1aa;  /* zinc-400 */\n}\n```\n\nThis approach automatically syncs with your theme toggle without JavaScript changes.\n\n### 4. Fine-Grained Element Styling\n\n**Source**: [Clerk Elements Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/overview)\n\n**Relevance**: For precise control over specific UI elements like buttons, cards, and inputs.\n\n**Example - Matching Your Blueprint Aesthetic**:\n\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    variables: {\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      colorPrimary: '#000000',\n    },\n    elements: {\n      // Main card container\n      card: {\n        border: '1px solid #000000',\n        boxShadow: 'none',\n      },\n      \n      // Card box (wrapper introduced in Core 2)\n      cardBox: {\n        boxShadow: 'none',\n      },\n      \n      // Primary buttons\n      formButtonPrimary: {\n        backgroundColor: '#000000',\n        color: '#ffffff',\n        border: '1px solid #000000',\n        borderRadius: '0px',\n        fontSize: '0.875rem',\n        fontWeight: 500,\n        transition: 'all 100ms ease',\n        '&:hover': {\n          backgroundColor: '#18181b', // zinc-900\n        },\n      },\n      \n      // Input fields\n      formFieldInput: {\n        borderRadius: '0px',\n        border: '1px solid #d4d4d8', // zinc-300\n        fontSize: '0.875rem',\n      },\n      \n      // Footer links\n      footerActionLink: {\n        color: '#000000',\n        textDecoration: 'none',\n        '&:hover': {\n          color: '#52525b', // zinc-600\n        },\n      },\n      \n      // Divider lines\n      dividerLine: {\n        backgroundColor: '#e4e4e7', // zinc-200\n      },\n    },\n  }}\n>\n  {children}\n</ClerkProvider>\n```\n\n**Finding Element Names**: Inspect Clerk components in DevTools and look for class names like `cl-formButtonPrimary`. Remove the `cl-` prefix to use as the key in the `elements` object.\n\n### 5. Available baseTheme Presets\n\n**Source**: [Clerk Themes Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/themes)\n\n**Relevance**: Clerk offers 6 preset themes, but for your custom design, you likely won't use these. However, they can be stacked.\n\n**Available Themes**:\n```tsx\nimport { \n  dark,           // Dark theme\n  neobrutalism,   // Sharp, bold design (might be useful!)\n  shadesOfPurple, // Purple accent theme\n  simple,         // Minimal theme\n  shadcn,         // shadcn/ui compatible theme\n} from '@clerk/themes'\n```\n\n**Neobrutalism Theme** might be interesting for your \"Technical Blueprint\" aesthetic as it emphasizes sharp corners and bold borders:\n\n```tsx\nimport { neobrutalism } from '@clerk/themes'\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    baseTheme: neobrutalism,\n    variables: {\n      colorPrimary: '#000000',\n      fontFamily: 'Switzer',\n      // Override neobrutalism's border radius if needed\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n    },\n  }}\n>\n```\n\n**Stacking Themes**: You can combine multiple themes:\n```tsx\nappearance={{\n  baseTheme: [dark, neobrutalism], // Last theme takes precedence on conflicts\n}}\n```\n\n### 6. Complete Implementation Example for Your Design System\n\n**Recommended Approach - Create a Reusable Theme File**:\n\n```tsx\n// src/lib/clerk-theme.ts\nimport type { Appearance } from '@clerk/types'\n\nexport const entourageClerkTheme: Appearance = {\n  variables: {\n    // Color palette - Black/White/Zinc\n    colorPrimary: '#000000',\n    colorForeground: '#000000',\n    colorBackground: '#ffffff',\n    colorNeutral: '#71717a',          // zinc-500\n    colorMutedForeground: '#a1a1aa',  // zinc-400\n    \n    colorInputBackground: '#ffffff',\n    colorInputForeground: '#000000',\n    \n    // Accent colors from your design system\n    colorDanger: '#f43f5e',    // Rose\n    colorSuccess: '#10b981',   // Emerald\n    colorWarning: '#f59e0b',   // Amber\n    \n    // Typography - Switzer font\n    fontFamily: 'var(--font-switzer), -apple-system, sans-serif',\n    fontSize: '0.875rem',      // 14px\n    fontWeight: {\n      normal: 400,\n      medium: 500,\n      semibold: 600,\n      bold: 700,\n    },\n    \n    // Sharp corners - NO border radius\n    borderRadius: '0px',\n    \n    // Spacing\n    spacing: '1rem',\n  },\n  \n  elements: {\n    // Card container - sharp corners, clean borders\n    card: {\n      border: '1px solid #000000',\n      boxShadow: 'none',\n    },\n    \n    cardBox: {\n      boxShadow: 'none',\n    },\n    \n    // Primary button - solid black\n    formButtonPrimary: {\n      backgroundColor: '#000000',\n      color: '#ffffff',\n      border: '1px solid #000000',\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      fontSize: '0.875rem',\n      fontWeight: 500,\n      textTransform: 'none',\n      transition: 'all 100ms ease',\n      \n      '&:hover': {\n        backgroundColor: '#18181b',\n      },\n      \n      '&:focus': {\n        boxShadow: '0 0 0 2px #000000',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    // Secondary button - outline style\n    formButtonSecondary: {\n      backgroundColor: 'transparent',\n      color: '#000000',\n      border: '1px solid #000000',\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      \n      '&:hover': {\n        backgroundColor: '#fafafa',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    // Input fields\n    formFieldInput: {\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      border: '1px solid #d4d4d8',\n      fontSize: '0.875rem',\n      \n      '&:focus': {\n        borderColor: '#000000',\n        boxShadow: '0 0 0 1px #000000',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    // Footer\n    footer: {\n      backgroundColor: 'transparent',\n      borderTop: '1px solid #e4e4e7',\n    },\n    \n    footerActionLink: {\n      color: '#000000',\n      fontSize: '0.875rem',\n      textDecoration: 'none',\n      \n      '&:hover': {\n        color: '#52525b',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    // Dividers\n    dividerLine: {\n      backgroundColor: '#e4e4e7',\n      height: '1px',\n    },\n    \n    // Social buttons\n    socialButtonsBlockButton: {\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      border: '1px solid #d4d4d8',\n      \n      '&:hover': {\n        backgroundColor: '#fafafa',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n\n// Dark mode variant\nexport const entourageClerkThemeDark: Appearance = {\n  variables: {\n    colorPrimary: '#ffffff',\n    colorForeground: '#ffffff',\n    colorBackground: '#000000',\n    colorNeutral: '#a1a1aa',          // zinc-400\n    colorMutedForeground: '#71717a',  // zinc-500\n    \n    colorInputBackground: '#000000',\n    colorInputForeground: '#ffffff',\n    \n    colorDanger: '#f43f5e',\n    colorSuccess: '#10b981',\n    colorWarning: '#f59e0b',\n    \n    fontFamily: 'var(--font-switzer), -apple-system, sans-serif',\n    fontSize: '0.875rem',\n    borderRadius: '0px',\n    spacing: '1rem',\n  },\n  \n  elements: {\n    card: {\n      border: '1px solid #ffffff',\n      boxShadow: 'none',\n    },\n    \n    cardBox: {\n      boxShadow: 'none',\n    },\n    \n    formButtonPrimary: {\n      backgroundColor: '#ffffff',\n      color: '#000000',\n      border: '1px solid #ffffff',\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      \n      '&:hover': {\n        backgroundColor: '#e4e4e7',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    formFieldInput: {\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      border: '1px solid #52525b',\n      \n      '&:focus': {\n        borderColor: '#ffffff',\n        boxShadow: '0 0 0 1px #ffffff',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    dividerLine: {\n      backgroundColor: '#3f3f46',\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### 7. Integration with Next.js and Theme Toggle\n\n**Dynamic Theme Switching**:\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useTheme } from 'next-themes'\nimport { entourageClerkTheme, entourageClerkThemeDark } from '@/lib/clerk-theme'\n\nfunction ClerkThemeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const { resolvedTheme } = useTheme()\n  \n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider\n      appearance={resolvedTheme === 'dark' ? entourageClerkThemeDark : entourageClerkTheme}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Or use CSS variables approach** (recommended for automatic sync):\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider\n      appearance={{\n        variables: {\n          borderRadius: '0px',\n          fontFamily: 'var(--font-switzer)',\n          // Other variables defined in globals.css via --clerk-* CSS vars\n        },\n      }}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### 8. Component-Specific Customization\n\n**Different styling for SignIn vs SignUp**:\n\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    // Global defaults\n    variables: { borderRadius: '0px' },\n    \n    // Component-specific overrides\n    signIn: {\n      elements: {\n        card: { border: '2px solid #000000' },\n      },\n    },\n    \n    signUp: {\n      elements: {\n        card: { border: '1px solid #000000' },\n      },\n    },\n  }}\n>\n```\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Clerk Appearance Prop Overview](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/overview) - Main customization guide\n- [Clerk Variables Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/variables) - Complete variable reference\n- [Clerk Themes Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/themes) - Preset themes and stacking\n- [Clerk CSS Variables Support Changelog](https://clerk.com/changelog/2025-07-15-clerk-css-variables-support) - New CSS variable features (July 2025)\n- [Bring Your Own CSS Guide](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/bring-your-own-css) - Advanced CSS customization\n- [Clerk Elements](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/elements/guides/styling) - Unstyled components for maximum customization\n\n## Browser Compatibility Note\n\nClerk's CSS variable system uses modern CSS features (`color-mix()` and relative color syntax) requiring:\n- Chrome 111+ (color-mix), 119+ (relative colors)\n- Firefox 113+ (color-mix), 120+ (relative colors)\n- Safari 16.2+ (color-mix), 16.4+ (relative colors)\n\nFor broader support, use static color values like `#000000` instead of CSS variables or color functions.\n\n## Key Takeaways for Your Implementation\n\n1. **Set `borderRadius: '0px'`** in variables - this is critical for sharp corners\n2. **Use Switzer font**: `fontFamily: 'var(--font-switzer), -apple-system, sans-serif'`\n3. **Black/White/Zinc palette**: Use `#000000`, `#ffffff`, and zinc shades (`#71717a`, `#a1a1aa`, `#d4d4d8`, `#e4e4e7`)\n4. **CSS variable approach** (new in 2025) integrates best with your design system\n5. **Remove box shadows**: Set `boxShadow: 'none'` on card elements for cleaner look\n6. **Consider neobrutalism theme** as a starting point - it has sharp corners by default\n\nSources:\n- [Clerk Appearance Prop Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/overview)\n- [Appearance Prop: Variables](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/variables)\n- [Appearance Prop: Themes](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/themes)\n- [Clerk CSS Variables Support](https://clerk.com/changelog/2025-07-15-clerk-css-variables-support)\n- [CSS Variables Support Announcement](https://clerk.com/changelog/2025-07-08-css-variables-support)\n- [Bring Your Own CSS](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/bring-your-own-css)\n- [Clerk Elements Styling](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/elements/guides/styling)\n- [Mastering Clerk Themes](https://www.codingeasypeasy.com/blog/mastering-clerk-themes-customize-your-authentication-ui-with-clerkthemes)"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a140918 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"uuid":"5b83a80c-7dc5-477c-9881-7e24c276a95f","timestamp":"2025-12-27T14:13:11.412Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Research how to customize Clerk authentication components to match a custom design system.\n\nI need to find:\n1.

Here's a comprehensive guide to matching Clerk components to your black/white/zinc design system with sharp corners.\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1. ClerkProvider Appearance Prop Structure\n\n**Source**: [Clerk Appearance Prop Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/overview)\n\n**Relevance**: The `appearance` prop is the main customization interface. It can be applied globally to `<ClerkProvider>` or to individual components like `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />`.\n\n**Key Structure**:\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    baseTheme: undefined,     // Optional preset theme\n    variables: {},            // General styles (colors, fonts, spacing)\n    elements: {},             // Fine-grained element styling\n    layout: {}                // Logo, terms links, etc.\n  }}\n>\n  {children}\n</ClerkProvider>\n```\n\n### 2. Available CSS Variables for Your Design System\n\n**Source**: [Clerk Variables Prop Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/variables)\n\n**Relevance**: These variables control the core visual properties that define your brand identity.\n\n**Complete Variable List for Black/White/Zinc Theme**:\n\n```tsx\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider\n      appearance={{\n        variables: {\n          // Colors - Black/White/Zinc palette\n          colorPrimary: '#000000',              // Primary actions (black)\n          colorForeground: '#000000',           // Primary text (black)\n          colorBackground: '#ffffff',           // Card background (white)\n          colorNeutral: '#71717a',              // Zinc-500 for neutral elements\n          colorMutedForeground: '#a1a1aa',      // Zinc-400 for muted text\n          \n          // Input fields\n          colorInputBackground: '#ffffff',      // White input backgrounds\n          colorInputForeground: '#000000',      // Black input text\n          \n          // State colors (can use your accent palette)\n          colorDanger: '#f43f5e',               // Rose for errors\n          colorSuccess: '#10b981',              // Emerald for success\n          colorWarning: '#f59e0b',              // Amber for warnings\n          \n          // Typography\n          fontFamily: 'Switzer, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif',\n          fontSize: '0.875rem',                 // 14px base\n          fontWeight: {\n            normal: 400,\n            medium: 500,\n            semibold: 600,\n            bold: 700,\n          },\n          \n          // Sharp corners - CRITICAL for your design\n          borderRadius: '0px',                  // NO border radius\n          \n          // Spacing\n          spacing: '1rem',                      // 16px spacing unit\n        },\n      }}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**CSS Variable Names**: All appearance variables are also available as CSS custom properties with the `--clerk-` prefix in kebab-case:\n- `colorPrimary` → `--clerk-color-primary`\n- `borderRadius` → `--clerk-border-radius`\n- `fontFamily` → `--clerk-font-family`\n\n### 3. Using CSS Variables Directly in Stylesheets\n\n**Source**: [Clerk CSS Variables Support](https://clerk.com/changelog/2025-07-15-clerk-css-variables-support)\n\n**Relevance**: As of July 2025, you can now define Clerk variables in your CSS instead of JavaScript, which integrates better with existing design systems.\n\n**Implementation in globals.css**:\n\n```css\n/* In your src/app/globals.css */\n:root {\n  /* Clerk theme variables - Light mode */\n  --clerk-color-primary: #000000;\n  --clerk-color-foreground: #000000;\n  --clerk-color-background: #ffffff;\n  --clerk-color-neutral: #71717a;  /* zinc-500 */\n  --clerk-border-radius: 0px;\n  --clerk-font-family: 'Switzer', -apple-system, sans-serif;\n}\n\n.dark {\n  /* Dark mode overrides */\n  --clerk-color-primary: #ffffff;\n  --clerk-color-foreground: #ffffff;\n  --clerk-color-background: #000000;\n  --clerk-color-neutral: #a1a1aa;  /* zinc-400 */\n}\n```\n\nThis approach automatically syncs with your theme toggle without JavaScript changes.\n\n### 4. Fine-Grained Element Styling\n\n**Source**: [Clerk Elements Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/overview)\n\n**Relevance**: For precise control over specific UI elements like buttons, cards, and inputs.\n\n**Example - Matching Your Blueprint Aesthetic**:\n\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    variables: {\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      colorPrimary: '#000000',\n    },\n    elements: {\n      // Main card container\n      card: {\n        border: '1px solid #000000',\n        boxShadow: 'none',\n      },\n      \n      // Card box (wrapper introduced in Core 2)\n      cardBox: {\n        boxShadow: 'none',\n      },\n      \n      // Primary buttons\n      formButtonPrimary: {\n        backgroundColor: '#000000',\n        color: '#ffffff',\n        border: '1px solid #000000',\n        borderRadius: '0px',\n        fontSize: '0.875rem',\n        fontWeight: 500,\n        transition: 'all 100ms ease',\n        '&:hover': {\n          backgroundColor: '#18181b', // zinc-900\n        },\n      },\n      \n      // Input fields\n      formFieldInput: {\n        borderRadius: '0px',\n        border: '1px solid #d4d4d8', // zinc-300\n        fontSize: '0.875rem',\n      },\n      \n      // Footer links\n      footerActionLink: {\n        color: '#000000',\n        textDecoration: 'none',\n        '&:hover': {\n          color: '#52525b', // zinc-600\n        },\n      },\n      \n      // Divider lines\n      dividerLine: {\n        backgroundColor: '#e4e4e7', // zinc-200\n      },\n    },\n  }}\n>\n  {children}\n</ClerkProvider>\n```\n\n**Finding Element Names**: Inspect Clerk components in DevTools and look for class names like `cl-formButtonPrimary`. Remove the `cl-` prefix to use as the key in the `elements` object.\n\n### 5. Available baseTheme Presets\n\n**Source**: [Clerk Themes Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/themes)\n\n**Relevance**: Clerk offers 6 preset themes, but for your custom design, you likely won't use these. However, they can be stacked.\n\n**Available Themes**:\n```tsx\nimport { \n  dark,           // Dark theme\n  neobrutalism,   // Sharp, bold design (might be useful!)\n  shadesOfPurple, // Purple accent theme\n  simple,         // Minimal theme\n  shadcn,         // shadcn/ui compatible theme\n} from '@clerk/themes'\n```\n\n**Neobrutalism Theme** might be interesting for your \"Technical Blueprint\" aesthetic as it emphasizes sharp corners and bold borders:\n\n```tsx\nimport { neobrutalism } from '@clerk/themes'\n\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    baseTheme: neobrutalism,\n    variables: {\n      colorPrimary: '#000000',\n      fontFamily: 'Switzer',\n      // Override neobrutalism's border radius if needed\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n    },\n  }}\n>\n```\n\n**Stacking Themes**: You can combine multiple themes:\n```tsx\nappearance={{\n  baseTheme: [dark, neobrutalism], // Last theme takes precedence on conflicts\n}}\n```\n\n### 6. Complete Implementation Example for Your Design System\n\n**Recommended Approach - Create a Reusable Theme File**:\n\n```tsx\n// src/lib/clerk-theme.ts\nimport type { Appearance } from '@clerk/types'\n\nexport const entourageClerkTheme: Appearance = {\n  variables: {\n    // Color palette - Black/White/Zinc\n    colorPrimary: '#000000',\n    colorForeground: '#000000',\n    colorBackground: '#ffffff',\n    colorNeutral: '#71717a',          // zinc-500\n    colorMutedForeground: '#a1a1aa',  // zinc-400\n    \n    colorInputBackground: '#ffffff',\n    colorInputForeground: '#000000',\n    \n    // Accent colors from your design system\n    colorDanger: '#f43f5e',    // Rose\n    colorSuccess: '#10b981',   // Emerald\n    colorWarning: '#f59e0b',   // Amber\n    \n    // Typography - Switzer font\n    fontFamily: 'var(--font-switzer), -apple-system, sans-serif',\n    fontSize: '0.875rem',      // 14px\n    fontWeight: {\n      normal: 400,\n      medium: 500,\n      semibold: 600,\n      bold: 700,\n    },\n    \n    // Sharp corners - NO border radius\n    borderRadius: '0px',\n    \n    // Spacing\n    spacing: '1rem',\n  },\n  \n  elements: {\n    // Card container - sharp corners, clean borders\n    card: {\n      border: '1px solid #000000',\n      boxShadow: 'none',\n    },\n    \n    cardBox: {\n      boxShadow: 'none',\n    },\n    \n    // Primary button - solid black\n    formButtonPrimary: {\n      backgroundColor: '#000000',\n      color: '#ffffff',\n      border: '1px solid #000000',\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      fontSize: '0.875rem',\n      fontWeight: 500,\n      textTransform: 'none',\n      transition: 'all 100ms ease',\n      \n      '&:hover': {\n        backgroundColor: '#18181b',\n      },\n      \n      '&:focus': {\n        boxShadow: '0 0 0 2px #000000',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    // Secondary button - outline style\n    formButtonSecondary: {\n      backgroundColor: 'transparent',\n      color: '#000000',\n      border: '1px solid #000000',\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      \n      '&:hover': {\n        backgroundColor: '#fafafa',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    // Input fields\n    formFieldInput: {\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      border: '1px solid #d4d4d8',\n      fontSize: '0.875rem',\n      \n      '&:focus': {\n        borderColor: '#000000',\n        boxShadow: '0 0 0 1px #000000',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    // Footer\n    footer: {\n      backgroundColor: 'transparent',\n      borderTop: '1px solid #e4e4e7',\n    },\n    \n    footerActionLink: {\n      color: '#000000',\n      fontSize: '0.875rem',\n      textDecoration: 'none',\n      \n      '&:hover': {\n        color: '#52525b',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    // Dividers\n    dividerLine: {\n      backgroundColor: '#e4e4e7',\n      height: '1px',\n    },\n    \n    // Social buttons\n    socialButtonsBlockButton: {\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      border: '1px solid #d4d4d8',\n      \n      '&:hover': {\n        backgroundColor: '#fafafa',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n\n// Dark mode variant\nexport const entourageClerkThemeDark: Appearance = {\n  variables: {\n    colorPrimary: '#ffffff',\n    colorForeground: '#ffffff',\n    colorBackground: '#000000',\n    colorNeutral: '#a1a1aa',          // zinc-400\n    colorMutedForeground: '#71717a',  // zinc-500\n    \n    colorInputBackground: '#000000',\n    colorInputForeground: '#ffffff',\n    \n    colorDanger: '#f43f5e',\n    colorSuccess: '#10b981',\n    colorWarning: '#f59e0b',\n    \n    fontFamily: 'var(--font-switzer), -apple-system, sans-serif',\n    fontSize: '0.875rem',\n    borderRadius: '0px',\n    spacing: '1rem',\n  },\n  \n  elements: {\n    card: {\n      border: '1px solid #ffffff',\n      boxShadow: 'none',\n    },\n    \n    cardBox: {\n      boxShadow: 'none',\n    },\n    \n    formButtonPrimary: {\n      backgroundColor: '#ffffff',\n      color: '#000000',\n      border: '1px solid #ffffff',\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      \n      '&:hover': {\n        backgroundColor: '#e4e4e7',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    formFieldInput: {\n      borderRadius: '0px',\n      border: '1px solid #52525b',\n      \n      '&:focus': {\n        borderColor: '#ffffff',\n        boxShadow: '0 0 0 1px #ffffff',\n      },\n    },\n    \n    dividerLine: {\n      backgroundColor: '#3f3f46',\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### 7. Integration with Next.js and Theme Toggle\n\n**Dynamic Theme Switching**:\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useTheme } from 'next-themes'\nimport { entourageClerkTheme, entourageClerkThemeDark } from '@/lib/clerk-theme'\n\nfunction ClerkThemeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const { resolvedTheme } = useTheme()\n  \n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider\n      appearance={resolvedTheme === 'dark' ? entourageClerkThemeDark : entourageClerkTheme}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Or use CSS variables approach** (recommended for automatic sync):\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/layout.tsx\nimport { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider\n      appearance={{\n        variables: {\n          borderRadius: '0px',\n          fontFamily: 'var(--font-switzer)',\n          // Other variables defined in globals.css via --clerk-* CSS vars\n        },\n      }}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### 8. Component-Specific Customization\n\n**Different styling for SignIn vs SignUp**:\n\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    // Global defaults\n    variables: { borderRadius: '0px' },\n    \n    // Component-specific overrides\n    signIn: {\n      elements: {\n        card: { border: '2px solid #000000' },\n      },\n    },\n    \n    signUp: {\n      elements: {\n        card: { border: '1px solid #000000' },\n      },\n    },\n  }}\n>\n```\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Clerk Appearance Prop Overview](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/overview) - Main customization guide\n- [Clerk Variables Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/variables) - Complete variable reference\n- [Clerk Themes Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/themes) - Preset themes and stacking\n- [Clerk CSS Variables Support Changelog](https://clerk.com/changelog/2025-07-15-clerk-css-variables-support) - New CSS variable features (July 2025)\n- [Bring Your Own CSS Guide](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/bring-your-own-css) - Advanced CSS customization\n- [Clerk Elements](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/elements/guides/styling) - Unstyled components for maximum customization\n\n## Browser Compatibility Note\n\nClerk's CSS variable system uses modern CSS features (`color-mix()` and relative color syntax) requiring:\n- Chrome 111+ (color-mix), 119+ (relative colors)\n- Firefox 113+ (color-mix), 120+ (relative colors)\n- Safari 16.2+ (color-mix), 16.4+ (relative colors)\n\nFor broader support, use static color values like `#000000` instead of CSS variables or color functions.\n\n## Key Takeaways for Your Implementation\n\n1. **Set `borderRadius: '0px'`** in variables - this is critical for sharp corners\n2. **Use Switzer font**: `fontFamily: 'var(--font-switzer), -apple-system, sans-serif'`\n3. **Black/White/Zinc palette**: Use `#000000`, `#ffffff`, and zinc shades (`#71717a`, `#a1a1aa`, `#d4d4d8`, `#e4e4e7`)\n4. **CSS variable approach** (new in 2025) integrates best with your design system\n5. **Remove box shadows**: Set `boxShadow: 'none'` on card elements for cleaner look\n6. **Consider neobrutalism theme** as a starting point - it has sharp corners by default\n\nSources:\n- [Clerk Appearance Prop Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/overview)\n- [Appearance Prop: Variables](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/variables)\n- [Appearance Prop: Themes](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/themes)\n- [Clerk CSS Variables Support](https://clerk.com/changelog/2025-07-15-clerk-css-variables-support)\n- [CSS Variables Support Announcement](https://clerk.com/changelog/2025-07-08-css-variables-support)\n- [Bring Your Own CSS](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/bring-your-own-css)\n- [Clerk Elements Styling](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/elements/guides/styling)\n- [Mastering Clerk Themes](https://www.codingeasypeasy.com/blog/mastering-clerk-themes-customize-your-authentication-ui-with-clerkthemes)"}],"totalDurationMs":234072,"totalTokens":28332,"totalToolUseCount":15,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3062,"cache_read_input_tokens":20614,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3062,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4649,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

I now have comprehensive information from both agents. Let me synthesize the findings:\n\n**Current State (from codebase-analyzer):**\n- ClerkProvider is configured in `src/app/layout.tsx` with appearance settings\n- Already has some customization:\n  - `borderRadius: \"0rem\"` for sharp corners\n  - `fontFamily: \"Switzer\"` for brand font\n  - Accent colors (emerald, rose, amber)\n  - Element-specific styling for buttons, cards, inputs, header, footer links\n  - Dark mode support via Tailwind `dark:` variants\n\n**Waitlist Page Design Features:**\n- Dashed border frame with Plus Corners\n- Monospace \"Early Access\" label\n- Centered layout with `flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center`\n- Custom branded form components (Input, Label, Button)\n\n**Key Gap:**\nThe sign-in page (`src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`) is very minimal - just renders `<SignIn />` in a centered container. It doesn't have:\n- Plus Corners\n- Dashed border frame\n- Section label (monospace)\n\n**Research from web-search-researcher:**\n- Complete guide to ClerkProvider appearance customization\n- Variables like `borderRadius: '0px'`, color palette, font family\n- Element styling for card, buttons, inputs, etc.\n- Recommendation for creating a theme file\n- neobrutalism theme as a potential starting point\n\nNow I need to:\n1. Create the research document\n2. Document how to make the Clerk auth pages match the waitlist page style\n\nThe key insight is that there are TWO levels of customization needed:\n1. **Clerk Component Styling** - Already partially done via `appearance` prop\n2. **Page Layout/Frame** - The Plus Corners and dashed frame need to be added to the page component itself (wrapping the `<SignIn />` component)\n\n\nI'll draft a comprehensive research document that captures the customization strategy. I'll break it down into clear sections: current setup, design requirements, implementation approach, and specific code modifications needed for both Clerk component styling and page-level design enhancements.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7684,"cache_read_input_tokens":86475,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7684,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":5,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWXL5CCXCM8Buxvf3zA9P","type":"assistant","uuid":"2580735d-dc1e-499d-a4f6-7bc0fe88422e","timestamp":"2025-12-27T14:13:29.663Z"}

To match this style for Clerk auth pages, there are **two levels of customization** needed:\n\n1. **Page Layout (wrapper)** - Add the Plus Corners frame and dashed border around the Clerk SignIn component\n2. **Clerk Component Styling (appearance prop)** - Already largely implemented via ClerkProvider in layout.tsx\n\nThe current sign-in page is very minimal and lacks the brand framing elements. The Clerk component itself is already styled to match the design system, but the page wrapper needs the Plus Corners treatment.\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### Current Waitlist Page Design\n\n**Location**: `src/app/waitlist/page.tsx`\n\nThe waitlist page implements the full Entourage design pattern:\n\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n  {/* Content wrapper with plus corners */}\n  <div className=\"relative w-full max-w-md px-6 py-12 md:px-8 md:py-16\">\n    {/* Dashed border */}\n    <div className=\"absolute inset-0 border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800\" />\n\n    {/* Plus corners */}\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n\n    {/* Content */}\n    <div className=\"relative text-center\">\n      <span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n        Early Access\n      </span>\n      <h1 className=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white md:text-3xl\">\n        Join the Waitlist\n      </h1>\n      <p className=\"mt-2 text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n        Be the first to know when we launch.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"mt-8\">\n        <WaitlistForm />\n      </div>\n      <Link href=\"/\" className=\"mt-6 inline-flex items-center gap-1 text-sm text-zinc-500 ...\">\n        &larr; Back to home\n      </Link>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Key Design Elements**:\n| Element | Implementation |\n|---------|----------------|\n| Plus Corners | 4x `<PlusCorner>` components at corners with `-top-2.5 -left-2.5` positioning |\n| Dashed Frame | Absolute positioned div with `border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800` |\n| Section Label | `text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider` text above heading |\n| Heading | `text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight` |\n| Container | `relative w-full max-w-md px-6 py-12 md:px-8 md:py-16` |\n| Back Link | Arrow with text linking to home |\n\n---\n\n### Current Sign-In Page Design\n\n**Location**: `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`\n\nThe current sign-in page is minimal:\n\n```tsx\nimport { SignIn } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n      <SignIn />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**What's Missing**:\n- Plus Corners frame\n- Dashed border\n- Section label (e.g., \"SIGN IN\" or \"WELCOME BACK\")\n- Back to home link\n\n---\n\n### Current Clerk Appearance Configuration\n\n**Location**: `src/app/layout.tsx:39-60`\n\nClerkProvider already has appearance configuration matching the design system:\n\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    variables: {\n      colorPrimary: \"#10B981\",           // Emerald accent\n      colorDanger: \"#F43F5E\",            // Rose\n      colorSuccess: \"#10B981\",           // Emerald\n      colorWarning: \"#F59E0B\",           // Amber\n      borderRadius: \"0rem\",              // Sharp corners\n      fontFamily: '\"Switzer\", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif',\n    },\n    elements: {\n      formButtonPrimary: \"bg-black dark:bg-white text-white dark:text-black border border-black dark:border-white rounded-none hover:bg-zinc-800 dark:hover:bg-zinc-100 transition-colors\",\n      card: \"bg-white dark:bg-black border border-black dark:border-white rounded-none shadow-none\",\n      headerTitle: \"text-black dark:text-white font-semibold\",\n      headerSubtitle: \"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\",\n      formFieldInput: \"rounded-none border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n      footerActionLink: \"text-emerald-500 hover:text-emerald-600\",\n    },\n  }}\n>\n```\n\n**What's Already Styled**:\n| Element | Status |\n|---------|--------|\n| Sharp corners (borderRadius: 0) | Done |\n| Switzer font | Done |\n| Primary button (solid black/white) | Done |\n| Card container | Done |\n| Input fields | Done |\n| Footer links (emerald) | Done |\n| Dark mode support | Done |\n\n---\n\n### How to Match Styles: Implementation Guide\n\n#### Option 1: Add Plus Corners Wrapper to Sign-In Page (Recommended)\n\nUpdate `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` to match the waitlist page structure:\n\n```tsx\nimport { SignIn } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\nimport { PlusCorner } from \"@/components/ui/PlusCorner\";\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n      {/* Content wrapper with plus corners */}\n      <div className=\"relative w-full max-w-md px-6 py-12 md:px-8 md:py-16\">\n        {/* Dashed border */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-0 border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800\" />\n\n        {/* Plus corners */}\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n\n        {/* Content */}\n        <div className=\"relative text-center\">\n          <span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n            Welcome Back\n          </span>\n          <h1 className=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white md:text-3xl\">\n            Sign In\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mt-2 text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n            Access your Entourage account.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"mt-8\">\n            <SignIn\n              appearance={{\n                elements: {\n                  // Hide Clerk's built-in header since we have our own\n                  headerTitle: \"hidden\",\n                  headerSubtitle: \"hidden\",\n                }\n              }}\n            />\n          </div>\n          <Link\n            href=\"/\"\n            className=\"mt-6 inline-flex items-center gap-1 text-sm text-zinc-500 hover:text-black dark:text-zinc-400 dark:hover:text-white transition-colors\"\n          >\n            &larr; Back to home\n          </Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Key Changes**:\n1.

Should the Clerk card border be removed when wrapped in Plus Corners frame? (Currently it would have double borders)\n2. Should we create a shared `AuthFrame` component for reuse across auth pages?\n3. Should Clerk's header be hidden in favor of our custom header for full brand control?\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":209,"cache_read_input_tokens":94851,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":209,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4894,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWXL7FRoSSEvoJrf4gxm3","type":"assistant","uuid":"ea65d00a-1a86-4071-8374-4d43babed939","timestamp":"2025-12-27T14:14:47.156Z"}

To match this style for Clerk auth pages, there are **two levels of customization** needed:\n\n1. **Page Layout (wrapper)** - Add the Plus Corners frame and dashed border around the Clerk SignIn component\n2. **Clerk Component Styling (appearance prop)** - Already largely implemented via ClerkProvider in layout.tsx\n\nThe current sign-in page is very minimal and lacks the brand framing elements. The Clerk component itself is already styled to match the design system, but the page wrapper needs the Plus Corners treatment.\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### Current Waitlist Page Design\n\n**Location**: `src/app/waitlist/page.tsx`\n\nThe waitlist page implements the full Entourage design pattern:\n\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n  {/* Content wrapper with plus corners */}\n  <div className=\"relative w-full max-w-md px-6 py-12 md:px-8 md:py-16\">\n    {/* Dashed border */}\n    <div className=\"absolute inset-0 border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800\" />\n\n    {/* Plus corners */}\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n\n    {/* Content */}\n    <div className=\"relative text-center\">\n      <span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n        Early Access\n      </span>\n      <h1 className=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white md:text-3xl\">\n        Join the Waitlist\n      </h1>\n      <p className=\"mt-2 text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n        Be the first to know when we launch.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"mt-8\">\n        <WaitlistForm />\n      </div>\n      <Link href=\"/\" className=\"mt-6 inline-flex items-center gap-1 text-sm text-zinc-500 ...\">\n        &larr; Back to home\n      </Link>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Key Design Elements**:\n| Element | Implementation |\n|---------|----------------|\n| Plus Corners | 4x `<PlusCorner>` components at corners with `-top-2.5 -left-2.5` positioning |\n| Dashed Frame | Absolute positioned div with `border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800` |\n| Section Label | `text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider` text above heading |\n| Heading | `text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight` |\n| Container | `relative w-full max-w-md px-6 py-12 md:px-8 md:py-16` |\n| Back Link | Arrow with text linking to home |\n\n---\n\n### Current Sign-In Page Design\n\n**Location**: `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`\n\nThe current sign-in page is minimal:\n\n```tsx\nimport { SignIn } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n      <SignIn />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**What's Missing**:\n- Plus Corners frame\n- Dashed border\n- Section label (e.g., \"SIGN IN\" or \"WELCOME BACK\")\n- Back to home link\n\n---\n\n### Current Clerk Appearance Configuration\n\n**Location**: `src/app/layout.tsx:39-60`\n\nClerkProvider already has appearance configuration matching the design system:\n\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    variables: {\n      colorPrimary: \"#10B981\",           // Emerald accent\n      colorDanger: \"#F43F5E\",            // Rose\n      colorSuccess: \"#10B981\",           // Emerald\n      colorWarning: \"#F59E0B\",           // Amber\n      borderRadius: \"0rem\",              // Sharp corners\n      fontFamily: '\"Switzer\", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif',\n    },\n    elements: {\n      formButtonPrimary: \"bg-black dark:bg-white text-white dark:text-black border border-black dark:border-white rounded-none hover:bg-zinc-800 dark:hover:bg-zinc-100 transition-colors\",\n      card: \"bg-white dark:bg-black border border-black dark:border-white rounded-none shadow-none\",\n      headerTitle: \"text-black dark:text-white font-semibold\",\n      headerSubtitle: \"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\",\n      formFieldInput: \"rounded-none border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n      footerActionLink: \"text-emerald-500 hover:text-emerald-600\",\n    },\n  }}\n>\n```\n\n**What's Already Styled**:\n| Element | Status |\n|---------|--------|\n| Sharp corners (borderRadius: 0) | Done |\n| Switzer font | Done |\n| Primary button (solid black/white) | Done |\n| Card container | Done |\n| Input fields | Done |\n| Footer links (emerald) | Done |\n| Dark mode support | Done |\n\n---\n\n### How to Match Styles: Implementation Guide\n\n#### Option 1: Add Plus Corners Wrapper to Sign-In Page (Recommended)\n\nUpdate `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` to match the waitlist page structure:\n\n```tsx\nimport { SignIn } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\nimport { PlusCorner } from \"@/components/ui/PlusCorner\";\nimport

border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800\" />\n\n        {/* Plus corners */}\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400

built-in header since we have our own\n                  headerTitle: \"hidden\",\n                  headerSubtitle: \"hidden\",\n                }\n              }}\n            />\n          </div>\n          <Link\n            href=\"/\"\n            className=\"mt-6 inline-flex items-center gap-1 text-sm text-zinc-500 hover:text-black dark:text-zinc-400 dark:hover:text-white

Added Plus Corners frame wrapper\n2. Added section label (\"Welcome Back\")\n3. Added custom heading and subtitle\n4. Hide Clerk's built-in header (optional, to avoid duplication)\n5. Added \"Back to home\" link\n\n#### Option 2: Create Reusable Auth Frame Component\n\nFor consistency across sign-in, sign-up (if added), and other auth pages:\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/layout/AuthFrame.tsx\nimport { PlusCorner } from \"@/components/ui/PlusCorner\";\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\nimport { ReactNode } from \"react\";\n\ninterface AuthFrameProps {\n  label: string;\n  title: string;\n  subtitle: string;\n  children: ReactNode;\n}\n\nexport function AuthFrame({ label, title, subtitle, children }: AuthFrameProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n      <div className=\"relative w-full max-w-md px-6 py-12 md:px-8 md:py-16\">\n        {/* Dashed border */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-0 border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800\" />\n\n        {/* Plus corners */}\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n\n        {/* Content */}\n        <div className=\"relative text-center\">\n          <span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n            {label}\n          </span>\n          <h1 className=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white md:text-3xl\">\n            {title}\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mt-2 text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n            {subtitle}\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"mt-8\">\n            {children}\n          </div>\n          <Link\n            href=\"/\"\n            className=\"mt-6 inline-flex items-center gap-1 text-sm text-zinc-500 hover:text-black dark:text-zinc-400 dark:hover:text-white transition-colors\"\n          >\n            &larr; Back to home\n          </Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n```tsx\n// src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\nimport { SignIn } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\nimport { AuthFrame } from \"@/components/layout/AuthFrame\";\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <AuthFrame\n      label=\"Welcome Back\"\n      title=\"Sign In\"\n      subtitle=\"Access your Entourage account.\"\n    >\n      <SignIn appearance={{ elements: { headerTitle: \"hidden\", headerSubtitle: \"hidden\" } }} />\n    </AuthFrame>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Clerk Theming Deep Dive\n\n#### Available Configuration Options\n\n**Variables** (global styling):\n| Variable | Current Value | Notes |\n|----------|---------------|-------|\n| `colorPrimary` | `#10B981` | Emerald accent |\n| `colorDanger` | `#F43F5E` | Rose for errors |\n| `colorSuccess` | `#10B981` | Emerald |\n| `colorWarning` | `#F59E0B` | Amber |\n| `borderRadius` | `0rem` | Sharp corners |\n| `fontFamily` | `Switzer` | Brand font |\n\n**Elements** (specific component styling):\n| Element Key | Purpose |\n|-------------|---------|\n| `card` | Main container card |\n| `cardBox` | Card wrapper (no shadow) |\n| `formButtonPrimary` | Submit buttons |\n| `formButtonSecondary` | Secondary actions |\n| `formFieldInput` | Input fields |\n| `headerTitle` | Card title |\n| `headerSubtitle` | Card subtitle |\n| `footer` | Footer area |\n| `footerActionLink` | Footer links |\n| `dividerLine` | \"OR\" dividers |\n| `socialButtonsBlockButton` | OAuth buttons |\n\n#### Hiding Clerk Header (when using custom heading)\n\n```tsx\n<SignIn\n  appearance={{\n    elements: {\n      headerTitle: \"hidden\",\n      headerSubtitle: \"hidden\",\n    }\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n#### Removing Card Border (if Plus Corners frame provides the border)\n\n```tsx\n<SignIn\n  appearance={{\n    elements: {\n      card: \"bg-transparent border-none shadow-none\",\n    }\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n#### Width Matching\n\nThe Clerk SignIn component has its own max-width. To ensure consistency:\n\n```tsx\n// Option A: Let Clerk card define width\n<div className=\"relative w-full max-w-md\"> {/* max-w-md = 448px */}\n\n// Option B: Override Clerk card width\n<SignIn\n  appearance={{\n    elements: {\n      rootBox: \"w-full\",\n      card: \"w-full max-w-none\",\n    }\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n#### Social Login Buttons\n\nIf using OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.), ensure they match:\n\n```tsx\nelements: {\n  socialButtonsBlockButton: \"rounded-none border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 hover:bg-zinc-50 dark:hover:bg-zinc-900\",\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Code References\n\n| File | Line(s) | Description |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| `src/app/waitlist/page.tsx` | 1-43 | Waitlist page with Plus Corners implementation |\n| `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` | 1-10 | Current minimal sign-in page |\n| `src/app/layout.tsx` | 39-60 | ClerkProvider appearance configuration |\n| `src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx` | - | Plus Corner SVG component |\n| `src/components/WaitlistForm.tsx` | 1-115 | Waitlist form with branded styling |\n| `docs/design-system.md` | 382-583 | Plus Corner System documentation |\n\n## Architecture Documentation\n\nThe Entourage design system uses a two-layer approach for branded pages:\n\n1. **Page Layout Layer**: The page component (e.g., `waitlist/page.tsx`) provides the branded frame with Plus Corners, dashed borders, section labels, and navigation links.\n\n2. **Component Layer**: The form/content inside (e.g., `<WaitlistForm />` or `<SignIn />`) handles the actual functionality and has its own styling that must align with the design system.\n\nFor Clerk components specifically:\n- Global appearance is set in `ClerkProvider` (layout.tsx)\n- Per-page overrides can be added directly to `<SignIn />` component\n- The page wrapper provides brand identity elements that Clerk cannot customize (Plus Corners)\n\n## Related Research\n\n- `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-waitlist-page-design-alignment.md` - Waitlist page design analysis\n- `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-clerk-supabase-resend-integration.md` - Clerk integration research\n- `thoughts/shared/plans/2025-12-27-signin-page-and-waitlist-flow.md` - Sign-in page implementation plan\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should the Clerk card border be removed when wrapped in Plus Corners frame? (Currently it would have double borders)\n2. Should we create a shared `AuthFrame` component for reuse across auth pages?\n3. Should Clerk's header be hidden in favor of our custom header for full brand control?\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n- **Pause for human verification**: After completing all automated verification for a phase, pause and inform the human that the phase is ready for manual testing. Use this format:\n  ```\n  Phase [N] Complete - Ready for Manual Verification\n\n  Automated verification passed:\n  - [List automated checks that passed]\n\n  Please perform the manual verification steps listed in the plan:\n  - [List manual verification items from the plan]\n\n  Let me know when manual testing is complete so I can proceed to Phase [N+1].\n  ```\n\nIf instructed to execute multiple phases consecutively, skip the pause until the last phase. Otherwise, assume you are just doing one phase.\n\ndo not check off items in the manual testing steps until confirmed by the user.\n\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"b8bbffe4-ad33-4432-b8d5-4e9305f9405b","timestamp":"2025-12-27T14:31:42.859Z"}

To match this style for Clerk auth pages, there are **two levels of customization** needed:\n    29→\n    30→1. **Page Layout (wrapper)** - Add the Plus Corners frame and dashed border around the Clerk SignIn component\n    31→2. **Clerk Component Styling (appearance prop)** - Already largely implemented via ClerkProvider in layout.tsx\n    32→\n    33→The current sign-in page is very minimal and lacks the brand framing elements.

To match this style for Clerk auth pages, there are **two levels of customization** needed:\n\n1. **Page Layout (wrapper)** - Add the Plus Corners frame and dashed border around the Clerk SignIn component\n2. **Clerk Component Styling (appearance prop)** - Already largely implemented via ClerkProvider in layout.tsx\n\nThe current sign-in page is very minimal and lacks the brand framing elements. The Clerk component itself is already styled to match the design system, but the page wrapper needs the Plus Corners treatment.\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### Current Waitlist Page Design\n\n**Location**: `src/app/waitlist/page.tsx`\n\nThe waitlist page implements the full Entourage design pattern:\n\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n  {/* Content wrapper with plus corners */}\n  <div className=\"relative w-full max-w-md px-6 py-12 md:px-8 md:py-16\">\n    {/* Dashed border */}\n    <div className=\"absolute inset-0 border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800\" />\n\n    {/* Plus corners */}\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n    <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n\n    {/* Content */}\n    <div className=\"relative text-center\">\n      <span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n        Early Access\n      </span>\n      <h1 className=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white md:text-3xl\">\n        Join the Waitlist\n      </h1>\n      <p className=\"mt-2 text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n        Be the first to know when we launch.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"mt-8\">\n        <WaitlistForm />\n      </div>\n      <Link href=\"/\" className=\"mt-6 inline-flex items-center gap-1 text-sm text-zinc-500 ...\">\n        &larr; Back to home\n      </Link>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Key Design Elements**:\n| Element | Implementation |\n|---------|----------------|\n| Plus Corners | 4x `<PlusCorner>` components at corners with `-top-2.5 -left-2.5` positioning |\n| Dashed Frame | Absolute positioned div with `border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800` |\n| Section Label | `text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider` text above heading |\n| Heading | `text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight` |\n| Container | `relative w-full max-w-md px-6 py-12 md:px-8 md:py-16` |\n| Back Link | Arrow with text linking to home |\n\n---\n\n### Current Sign-In Page Design\n\n**Location**: `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`\n\nThe current sign-in page is minimal:\n\n```tsx\nimport { SignIn } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n      <SignIn />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**What's Missing**:\n- Plus Corners frame\n- Dashed border\n- Section label (e.g., \"SIGN IN\" or \"WELCOME BACK\")\n- Back to home link\n\n---\n\n### Current Clerk Appearance Configuration\n\n**Location**: `src/app/layout.tsx:39-60`\n\nClerkProvider already has appearance configuration matching the design system:\n\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    variables: {\n      colorPrimary: \"#10B981\",           // Emerald accent\n      colorDanger: \"#F43F5E\",            // Rose\n      colorSuccess: \"#10B981\",           // Emerald\n      colorWarning: \"#F59E0B\",           // Amber\n      borderRadius: \"0rem\",              // Sharp corners\n      fontFamily: '\"Switzer\", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif',\n    },\n    elements: {\n      formButtonPrimary: \"bg-black dark:bg-white text-white dark:text-black border border-black dark:border-white rounded-none hover:bg-zinc-800 dark:hover:bg-zinc-100 transition-colors\",\n      card: \"bg-white dark:bg-black border border-black dark:border-white rounded-none shadow-none\",\n      headerTitle: \"text-black dark:text-white font-semibold\",\n      headerSubtitle: \"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\",\n      formFieldInput: \"rounded-none border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n      footerActionLink: \"text-emerald-500 hover:text-emerald-600\",\n    },\n  }}\n>\n```\n\n**What's Already Styled**:\n| Element | Status |\n|---------|--------|\n| Sharp corners (borderRadius: 0) | Done |\n| Switzer font | Done |\n| Primary button (solid black/white) | Done |\n| Card container | Done |\n| Input fields | Done |\n| Footer links (emerald) | Done |\n| Dark mode support | Done |\n\n---\n\n### How to Match Styles: Implementation Guide\n\n#### Option 1: Add Plus Corners Wrapper to Sign-In Page (Recommended)\n\nUpdate `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` to match the waitlist page structure:\n\n```tsx\nimport { SignIn } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\nimport { PlusCorner } from \"@/components/ui/PlusCorner\";\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n      {/* Content wrapper with plus corners */}\n      <div className=\"relative w-full max-w-md px-6 py-12 md:px-8 md:py-16\">\n        {/* Dashed border */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-0 border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800\" />\n\n        {/* Plus corners */}\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n\n        {/* Content */}\n        <div className=\"relative text-center\">\n          <span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n            Welcome Back\n          </span>\n          <h1 className=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white md:text-3xl\">\n            Sign In\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mt-2 text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n

built-in header since we have our own\n                  headerTitle: \"hidden\",\n                  headerSubtitle: \"hidden\",\n                }\n              }}\n            />\n          </div>\n          <Link\n            href=\"/\"\n            className=\"mt-6 inline-flex items-center gap-1 text-sm text-zinc-500 hover:text-black dark:text-zinc-400 dark:hover:text-white

Added Plus Corners frame wrapper\n2. Added section label (\"Welcome Back\")\n3. Added custom heading and subtitle\n4. Hide Clerk's built-in header (optional, to avoid duplication)\n5. Added \"Back to home\" link\n\n#### Option 2: Create Reusable Auth Frame Component\n\nFor consistency across sign-in, sign-up (if added), and other auth pages:\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/layout/AuthFrame.tsx\nimport { PlusCorner } from \"@/components/ui/PlusCorner\";\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\nimport { ReactNode } from \"react\";\n\ninterface AuthFrameProps {\n  label: string;\n  title: string;\n  subtitle: string;\n  children: ReactNode;\n}\n\nexport function AuthFrame({ label, title, subtitle, children }: AuthFrameProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center bg-white dark:bg-black px-6\">\n      <div className=\"relative w-full max-w-md px-6 py-12 md:px-8 md:py-16\">\n        {/* Dashed border */}\n        <div className=\"absolute inset-0 border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800\" />\n\n        {/* Plus corners */}\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n        <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n\n        {/* Content */}\n        <div className=\"relative text-center\">\n          <span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n            {label}\n          </span>\n          <h1 className=\"mt-2 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white md:text-3xl\">\n            {title}\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mt-2 text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\">\n            {subtitle}\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"mt-8\">\n            {children}\n          </div>\n          <Link\n            href=\"/\"\n            className=\"mt-6 inline-flex items-center gap-1 text-sm text-zinc-500 hover:text-black dark:text-zinc-400 dark:hover:text-white transition-colors\"\n          >\n            &larr; Back to home\n          </Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n```tsx\n// src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx\nimport { SignIn } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\nimport { AuthFrame } from \"@/components/layout/AuthFrame\";\n\nexport default function SignInPage() {\n  return (\n    <AuthFrame\n      label=\"Welcome Back\"\n      title=\"Sign In\"\n      subtitle=\"Access your Entourage account.\"\n    >\n      <SignIn appearance={{ elements: { headerTitle: \"hidden\", headerSubtitle: \"hidden\" } }} />\n    </AuthFrame>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Clerk Theming Deep Dive\n\n#### Available Configuration Options\n\n**Variables** (global styling):\n| Variable | Current Value | Notes |\n|----------|---------------|-------|\n| `colorPrimary` | `#10B981` | Emerald accent |\n| `colorDanger` | `#F43F5E` | Rose for errors |\n| `colorSuccess` | `#10B981` | Emerald |\n| `colorWarning` | `#F59E0B` | Amber |\n| `borderRadius` | `0rem` | Sharp corners |\n| `fontFamily` | `Switzer` | Brand font |\n\n**Elements** (specific component styling):\n| Element Key | Purpose |\n|-------------|---------|\n| `card` | Main container card |\n| `cardBox` | Card wrapper (no shadow) |\n| `formButtonPrimary` | Submit buttons |\n| `formButtonSecondary` | Secondary actions |\n| `formFieldInput` | Input fields |\n| `headerTitle` | Card title |\n| `headerSubtitle` | Card subtitle |\n| `footer` | Footer area |\n| `footerActionLink` | Footer links |\n| `dividerLine` | \"OR\" dividers |\n| `socialButtonsBlockButton` | OAuth buttons |\n\n#### Hiding Clerk Header (when using custom heading)\n\n```tsx\n<SignIn\n  appearance={{\n    elements: {\n      headerTitle: \"hidden\",\n      headerSubtitle: \"hidden\",\n    }\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n#### Removing Card Border (if Plus Corners frame provides the border)\n\n```tsx\n<SignIn\n  appearance={{\n    elements: {\n      card: \"bg-transparent border-none shadow-none\",\n    }\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n#### Width Matching\n\nThe Clerk SignIn component has its own max-width. To ensure consistency:\n\n```tsx\n// Option A: Let Clerk card define width\n<div className=\"relative w-full max-w-md\"> {/* max-w-md = 448px */}\n\n// Option B: Override Clerk card width\n<SignIn\n  appearance={{\n    elements: {\n      rootBox: \"w-full\",\n      card: \"w-full max-w-none\",\n    }\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n#### Social Login Buttons\n\nIf using OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.), ensure they match:\n\n```tsx\nelements: {\n  socialButtonsBlockButton: \"rounded-none border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 hover:bg-zinc-50 dark:hover:bg-zinc-900\",\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Code References\n\n| File | Line(s) | Description |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| `src/app/waitlist/page.tsx` | 1-43 | Waitlist page with Plus Corners implementation |\n| `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` | 1-10 | Current minimal sign-in page |\n| `src/app/layout.tsx` | 39-60 | ClerkProvider appearance configuration |\n| `src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx` | - | Plus Corner SVG component |\n| `src/components/WaitlistForm.tsx` | 1-115 | Waitlist form with branded styling |\n| `docs/design-system.md` | 382-583 | Plus Corner System documentation |\n\n## Architecture Documentation\n\nThe Entourage design system uses a two-layer approach for branded pages:\n\n1. **Page Layout Layer**: The page component (e.g., `waitlist/page.tsx`) provides the branded frame with Plus Corners, dashed borders, section labels, and navigation links.\n\n2. **Component Layer**: The form/content inside (e.g., `<WaitlistForm />` or `<SignIn />`) handles the actual functionality and has its own styling that must align with the design system.\n\nFor Clerk components specifically:\n- Global appearance is set in `ClerkProvider` (layout.tsx)\n- Per-page overrides can be added directly to `<SignIn />` component\n- The page wrapper provides brand identity elements that Clerk cannot customize (Plus Corners)\n\n## Related Research\n\n- `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-waitlist-page-design-alignment.md` - Waitlist page design analysis\n- `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-clerk-supabase-resend-integration.md` - Clerk integration research\n- `thoughts/shared/plans/2025-12-27-signin-page-and-waitlist-flow.md` - Sign-in page implementation plan\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should the Clerk card border be removed when wrapped in Plus Corners frame? (Currently it would have double borders)\n2. Should we create a shared `AuthFrame` component for reuse across auth pages?\n3. Should Clerk's header be hidden in favor of our custom header for full brand control?\n","numLines":427,"startLine":1,"totalLines":427}}}

Now I have comprehensive information. Let me compile a detailed response for the user.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've found comprehensive information about fully customizing Clerk authentication in Next.js. Here's what you need to know:\n\n**IMPORTANT CAVEAT**: Clerk Elements (their unstyled primitives system) is **no longer in active development** and will not receive updates. Clerk is building a replacement with a different customization approach. However, the **`useSignIn()` and `useSignUp()` hooks** remain the best path for fully custom authentication UIs.\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1. Clerk Elements (Beta - Deprecated)\n\n**Status**: No longer in development, replacement coming soon\n\n**What it was**: Unstyled UI primitives that provided composable components for building completely custom authentication flows on top of Clerk's APIs.\n\n**Key Features**:\n- Full control over markup and styling\n- `asChild` prop for composition with existing component libraries (like shadcn/ui)\n- Accessible components (OTP inputs, password validation)\n- `className` prop support for Tailwind CSS\n\n**Current recommendation**: While Elements still works, it's not receiving updates. Focus on **custom flows with hooks** instead.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Custom Flows with `useSignIn()` Hook (Recommended)\n\nThis is the most advanced and flexible approach for building completely custom sign-in UIs.\n\n#### Basic Sign-In Example (Next.js App Router)\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function CustomSignInForm() {\n  const { isLoaded, signIn, setActive } = useSignIn()\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('')\n  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('')\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      const signInAttempt = await signIn.create({\n        identifier: email,\n        password,\n      })\n\n      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({ session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId })\n        router.push('/dashboard')\n      } else {\n        // Handle other statuses (needs_second_factor, etc.)\n        console.error(JSON.stringify(signInAttempt, null, 2))\n      }\n    } catch (err: any) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      {/* Your completely custom UI here */}\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n        <input\n          id=\"email\"\n          type=\"email\"\n          value={email}\n          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n          className=\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\" // Your custom styles\n        />\n      </div>\n      \n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"password\">Password</label>\n        <input\n          id=\"password\"\n          type=\"password\"\n          value={password}\n          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n          className=\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      \n      <button type=\"submit\" className=\"bg-black text-white\">\n        Sign In\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Handling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\nimport type { EmailCodeFactor } from '@clerk/types'\n\nexport default function SignInWithMFA() {\n  const { isLoaded, signIn, setActive } = useSignIn()\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('')\n  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('')\n  const [code, setCode] = React.useState('')\n  const [showEmailCode, setShowEmailCode] = React.useState(false)\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      const signInAttempt = await signIn.create({\n        identifier: email,\n        password,\n      })\n\n      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({\n          session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId,\n          navigate: async ({ session }) => {\n            if (session?.currentTask) {\n              console.log(session?.currentTask)\n              return\n            }\n            router.push('/')\n          },\n        })\n      } else if (signInAttempt.status === 'needs_second_factor') {\n        // Find email code factor\n        const emailCodeFactor = signInAttempt.supportedSecondFactors?.find(\n          (factor): factor is EmailCodeFactor => factor.strategy === 'email_code',\n        )\n\n        if (emailCodeFactor) {\n          await signIn.prepareSecondFactor({\n            strategy: 'email_code',\n            emailAddressId: emailCodeFactor.emailAddressId,\n          })\n          setShowEmailCode(true)\n        }\n      } else {\n        console.error(JSON.stringify(signInAttempt, null, 2))\n      }\n    } catch (err: any) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  const handleEmailCode = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      const signInAttempt = await signIn.attemptSecondFactor({\n        strategy: 'email_code',\n        code,\n      })\n\n      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({\n          session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId,\n          navigate: async ({ session }) => {\n            if (session?.currentTask) {\n              console.log(session?.currentTask)\n              return\n            }\n            router.push('/')\n          },\n        })\n      } else {\n        console.error(JSON.stringify(signInAttempt, null, 2))\n      }\n    } catch (err: any) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (showEmailCode) {\n    return (\n      <form onSubmit={handleEmailCode}>\n        <h1>Verify your email</h1>\n        <input\n          type=\"text\"\n          inputMode=\"numeric\"\n          value={code}\n          onChange={(e) => setCode(e.target.value)}\n          className=\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\"\n        />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Verify</button>\n      </form>\n    )\n  }\n\n  // ... return main form\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. OAuth Authentication with Custom UI\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function OAuthSignIn() {\n  const { signIn } = useSignIn()\n\n  const signInWith = (strategy: 'oauth_google' | 'oauth_github') => {\n    return signIn.authenticateWithRedirect({\n      strategy,\n      redirectUrl: '/sign-in/sso-callback',\n      redirectUrlComplete: '/dashboard'\n    })\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* Your custom buttons */}\n      <button\n        onClick={() => signInWith('oauth_google')}\n        className=\"w-full rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\"\n      >\n        Sign in with Google\n      </button>\n      \n      <button\n        onClick={() => signInWith('oauth_github')}\n        className=\"w-full rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\"\n      >\n        Sign in with GitHub\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**OAuth Callback Handler** (at `/sign-in/sso-callback/page.tsx`):\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function SSOCallback() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback continueSignUpUrl=\"/sign-in/continue\" />\n      <div id=\"clerk-captcha\" /> {/* Required for sign-up flows */}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. Magic Link Authentication\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function MagicLinkSignIn() {\n  const { signIn, isLoaded } = useSignIn()\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('')\n  const [showSuccess, setShowSuccess] = React.useState(false)\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      const { supportedFirstFactors } = await signIn.create({\n        identifier: email,\n      })\n\n      const emailLinkFactor = supportedFirstFactors?.find(\n        factor => factor.strategy === 'email_link'\n      )\n\n      if (emailLinkFactor) {\n        await signIn.prepareFirstFactor({\n          strategy: 'email_link',\n          emailAddressId: emailLinkFactor.emailAddressId,\n        })\n        setShowSuccess(true)\n      }\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (showSuccess) {\n    return <div>Check your email for the sign-in link!</div>\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        className=\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\"\n      />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Send magic link</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Error Handling\n\nClerk provides detailed error information via `ClerkAPIError`:\n\n```tsx\nimport { isClerkAPIResponseError } from '@clerk/nextjs/errors'\nimport type { ClerkAPIError } from '@clerk/types'\n\nexport default function SignInWithErrors() {\n  const [errors, setErrors] = React.useState<ClerkAPIError[]>([])\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    setErrors([]) // Clear previous errors\n\n    try {\n      // ... sign in logic\n    } catch (err) {\n      if (isClerkAPIResponseError(err)) {\n        setErrors(err.errors)\n      }\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      {/* Your form fields */}\n      \n      {errors.length > 0 && (\n        <div className=\"border border-rose-500 p-4\">\n          <ul>\n            {errors.map((error, index) => (\n              <li key={index} className=\"text-rose-500\">\n                {error.longMessage}\n              </li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      )}\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Error Structure**:\n- `code`: Error identifier (e.g., `form_password_validation_failed`)\n- `message`: Short error message\n- `longMessage`: Detailed error description\n- `meta`: Additional metadata (parameter names, etc.)\n\n---\n\n### 7. Custom Sign-Up Flow\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function CustomSignUp() {\n  const { isLoaded, signUp, setActive } = useSignUp()\n  const [emailAddress, setEmailAddress] = React.useState('')\n  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('')\n  const [verifying, setVerifying] = React.useState(false)\n  const [code, setCode] = React.useState('')\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      await signUp.create({\n        emailAddress,\n        password,\n      })\n\n      await signUp.prepareEmailAddressVerification({\n        strategy: 'email_code',\n      })\n\n      setVerifying(true)\n    } catch (err: any) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  const handleVerify = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      const completeSignUp = await signUp.attemptEmailAddressVerification({\n        code,\n      })\n\n      if (completeSignUp.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({ session: completeSignUp.createdSessionId })\n        router.push('/')\n      }\n    } catch (err: any) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (verifying) {\n    return (\n      <form onSubmit={handleVerify}>\n        <h2>Verify your email</h2>\n        <input\n          type=\"text\"\n          value={code}\n          onChange={(e) => setCode(e.target.value)}\n          placeholder=\"Enter verification code\"\n        />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Verify</button>\n      </form>\n    )\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={emailAddress}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmailAddress(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Sign up</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8. Removing Clerk Branding\n\nTo completely white-label your authentication:\n\n1. **In Clerk Dashboard**:\n   - Navigate to Settings → Branding\n   - Toggle on \"Remove 'Secured by Clerk' branding\"\n   - **Note**: Requires a paid plan ($25/month Pro plan) for production\n\n2. **Using Custom Flows**: When you build with `useSignIn()` and `useSignUp()` hooks, there's NO Clerk branding at all - you have complete control over every pixel.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Tailwind v4 Configuration\n\nSince you're using Tailwind v4, add this to your `<ClerkProvider>`:\n\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    cssLayerName: 'clerk' // Ensures Tailwind utilities are applied after Clerk's styles\n  }}\n>\n  {children}\n</ClerkProvider>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 10. Complete Custom Sign-In Page Example (Your Design System)\n\nHere's a complete example matching your design system (sharp corners, black/white, no Clerk branding):\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport *

const signInAttempt = await signIn.create({\n        identifier: email,\n        password,\n      })\n\n      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({ session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId })\n        router.push('/dashboard')\n      } else {\n        console.error('Incomplete sign-in:', signInAttempt)\n      }\n    } catch (err) {\n      if

Now I have comprehensive information. Let me compile a detailed response for the user.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've found comprehensive information about fully customizing Clerk authentication in Next.js. Here's what you need to know:\n\n**IMPORTANT CAVEAT**: Clerk Elements (their unstyled primitives system) is **no longer in active development** and will not receive updates. Clerk is building a replacement with a different customization approach. However, the **`useSignIn()` and `useSignUp()` hooks** remain the best path for fully custom authentication UIs.\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1. Clerk Elements (Beta - Deprecated)\n\n**Status**: No longer in development, replacement coming soon\n\n**What it was**: Unstyled UI primitives that provided composable components for building completely custom authentication flows on top of Clerk's APIs.\n\n**Key Features**:\n- Full control over markup and styling\n- `asChild` prop for composition with existing component libraries (like shadcn/ui)\n- Accessible components (OTP inputs, password validation)\n- `className` prop support for Tailwind CSS\n\n**Current recommendation**: While Elements still works, it's not receiving updates. Focus on **custom flows with hooks** instead.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Custom Flows with `useSignIn()` Hook (Recommended)\n\nThis is the most advanced and flexible approach for building completely custom sign-in UIs.\n\n#### Basic Sign-In Example (Next.js App Router)\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function CustomSignInForm() {\n  const { isLoaded, signIn, setActive } = useSignIn()\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('')\n  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('')\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      const signInAttempt = await signIn.create({\n        identifier: email,\n        password,\n      })\n\n      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({ session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId })\n        router.push('/dashboard')\n      } else {\n        // Handle other statuses (needs_second_factor, etc.)\n        console.error(JSON.stringify(signInAttempt, null, 2))\n      }\n    } catch (err: any) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      {/* Your completely custom UI here */}\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n        <input\n          id=\"email\"\n          type=\"email\"\n          value={email}\n          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n          className=\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\" // Your custom styles\n        />\n      </div>\n      \n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"password\">Password</label>\n        <input\n          id=\"password\"\n          type=\"password\"\n          value={password}\n          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n          className=\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      \n      <button type=\"submit\" className=\"bg-black text-white\">\n        Sign In\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Handling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\nimport type { EmailCodeFactor } from '@clerk/types'\n\nexport default function SignInWithMFA() {\n  const { isLoaded, signIn, setActive } = useSignIn()\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('')\n  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('')\n  const [code, setCode] = React.useState('')\n  const [showEmailCode, setShowEmailCode] = React.useState(false)\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      const signInAttempt = await signIn.create({\n        identifier: email,\n        password,\n      })\n\n      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({\n          session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId,\n          navigate: async ({ session }) => {\n            if (session?.currentTask) {\n              console.log(session?.currentTask)\n              return\n            }\n            router.push('/')\n          },\n        })\n      } else if (signInAttempt.status === 'needs_second_factor') {\n        // Find email code factor\n        const emailCodeFactor = signInAttempt.supportedSecondFactors?.find(\n          (factor): factor is EmailCodeFactor => factor.strategy === 'email_code',\n        )\n\n        if (emailCodeFactor) {\n          await signIn.prepareSecondFactor({\n            strategy: 'email_code',\n            emailAddressId: emailCodeFactor.emailAddressId,\n          })\n          setShowEmailCode(true)\n        }\n      } else {\n        console.error(JSON.stringify(signInAttempt, null, 2))\n      }\n    } catch (err: any) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  const handleEmailCode = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      const signInAttempt = await signIn.attemptSecondFactor({\n        strategy: 'email_code',\n        code,\n      })\n\n      if (signInAttempt.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({\n          session: signInAttempt.createdSessionId,\n          navigate: async ({ session }) => {\n            if (session?.currentTask) {\n              console.log(session?.currentTask)\n              return\n            }\n            router.push('/')\n          },\n        })\n      } else {\n        console.error(JSON.stringify(signInAttempt, null, 2))\n      }\n    } catch (err: any) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (showEmailCode) {\n    return (\n      <form onSubmit={handleEmailCode}>\n        <h1>Verify your email</h1>\n        <input\n          type=\"text\"\n          inputMode=\"numeric\"\n          value={code}\n          onChange={(e) => setCode(e.target.value)}\n          className=\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\"\n        />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Verify</button>\n      </form>\n    )\n  }\n\n  // ... return main form\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. OAuth Authentication with Custom UI\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function OAuthSignIn() {\n  const { signIn } = useSignIn()\n\n  const signInWith = (strategy: 'oauth_google' | 'oauth_github') => {\n    return signIn.authenticateWithRedirect({\n      strategy,\n      redirectUrl: '/sign-in/sso-callback',\n      redirectUrlComplete: '/dashboard'\n    })\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* Your custom buttons */}\n      <button\n        onClick={() => signInWith('oauth_google')}\n        className=\"w-full rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\"\n      >\n        Sign in with Google\n      </button>\n      \n      <button\n        onClick={() => signInWith('oauth_github')}\n        className=\"w-full rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\"\n      >\n        Sign in with GitHub\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**OAuth Callback Handler** (at `/sign-in/sso-callback/page.tsx`):\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function SSOCallback() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback continueSignUpUrl=\"/sign-in/continue\" />\n      <div id=\"clerk-captcha\" /> {/* Required for sign-up flows */}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. Magic Link Authentication\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\nexport default function MagicLinkSignIn() {\n  const { signIn, isLoaded } = useSignIn()\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('')\n  const [showSuccess, setShowSuccess] = React.useState(false)\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      const { supportedFirstFactors } = await signIn.create({\n        identifier: email,\n      })\n\n      const emailLinkFactor = supportedFirstFactors?.find(\n        factor => factor.strategy === 'email_link'\n      )\n\n      if (emailLinkFactor) {\n        await signIn.prepareFirstFactor({\n          strategy: 'email_link',\n          emailAddressId: emailLinkFactor.emailAddressId,\n        })\n        setShowSuccess(true)\n      }\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (showSuccess) {\n    return <div>Check your email for the sign-in link!</div>\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        className=\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\"\n      />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Send magic link</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Error Handling\n\nClerk provides detailed error information via `ClerkAPIError`:\n\n```tsx\nimport { isClerkAPIResponseError } from '@clerk/nextjs/errors'\nimport type { ClerkAPIError } from '@clerk/types'\n\nexport default function SignInWithErrors() {\n  const [errors, setErrors] = React.useState<ClerkAPIError[]>([])\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    setErrors([]) // Clear previous errors\n\n    try {\n      // ... sign in logic\n    } catch (err) {\n      if (isClerkAPIResponseError(err)) {\n        setErrors(err.errors)\n      }\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      {/* Your form fields */}\n      \n      {errors.length > 0 && (\n        <div className=\"border border-rose-500 p-4\">\n          <ul>\n            {errors.map((error, index) => (\n              <li key={index} className=\"text-rose-500\">\n                {error.longMessage}\n              </li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      )}\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Error Structure**:\n- `code`: Error identifier (e.g., `form_password_validation_failed`)\n- `message`: Short error message\n- `longMessage`: Detailed error description\n- `meta`: Additional metadata (parameter names, etc.)\n\n---\n\n### 7. Custom Sign-Up Flow\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport * as React from 'react'\nimport { useSignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function CustomSignUp() {\n  const { isLoaded, signUp, setActive } = useSignUp()\n  const [emailAddress, setEmailAddress] = React.useState('')\n  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('')\n  const [verifying, setVerifying] = React.useState(false)\n  const [code, setCode] = React.useState('')\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      await signUp.create({\n        emailAddress,\n        password,\n      })\n\n      await signUp.prepareEmailAddressVerification({\n        strategy: 'email_code',\n      })\n\n      setVerifying(true)\n    } catch (err: any) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  const handleVerify = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    if (!isLoaded) return\n\n    try {\n      const completeSignUp = await signUp.attemptEmailAddressVerification({\n        code,\n      })\n\n      if (completeSignUp.status === 'complete') {\n        await setActive({ session: completeSignUp.createdSessionId })\n        router.push('/')\n      }\n    } catch (err: any) {\n      console.error(JSON.stringify(err, null, 2))\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (verifying) {\n    return (\n      <form onSubmit={handleVerify}>\n        <h2>Verify your email</h2>\n        <input\n          type=\"text\"\n          value={code}\n          onChange={(e) => setCode(e.target.value)}\n          placeholder=\"Enter verification code\"\n        />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Verify</button>\n      </form>\n    )\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={emailAddress}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmailAddress(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Sign up</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8. Removing Clerk Branding\n\nTo completely white-label your authentication:\n\n1. **In Clerk Dashboard**:\n   - Navigate to Settings → Branding\n   - Toggle on \"Remove 'Secured by Clerk' branding\"\n   - **Note**: Requires a paid plan ($25/month Pro plan) for production\n\n2. **Using Custom Flows**: When you build with `useSignIn()` and `useSignUp()` hooks, there's NO Clerk branding at all - you have complete control over every pixel.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Tailwind v4 Configuration\n\nSince you're using Tailwind v4, add this to your `<ClerkProvider>`:\n\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    cssLayerName: 'clerk' // Ensures Tailwind utilities are applied after Clerk's styles\n  }}\n>\n  {children}\n</ClerkProvider>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 10. Complete Custom Sign-In Page Example (Your Design System)\n\nHere's a complete example matching your design system (sharp corners, black/white, no Clerk branding):\n\n```tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport *

Install: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n2. Components install to `src/components/ui/`\n3. **Never modify ShadCN files directly**\n4.
