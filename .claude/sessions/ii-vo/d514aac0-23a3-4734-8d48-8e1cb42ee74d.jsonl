Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n\n2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n\n   **For codebase research:**\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)\n   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to find examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.\n\n   **For thoughts directory:**\n   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic\n   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)\n\n   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n\n   **For Linear tickets (if relevant):**\n   - Use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details of a specific ticket\n   - Use the **linear-searcher** agent to find related tickets or historical context\n\n   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings to document how they work\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n   - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving\n\n4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/allison/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n\n5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**\n   - Run the `hack/spec_metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata\n   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n     - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n       - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n       - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic\n     - Examples:\n       - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n       - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`\n\n6. **Generate research document:**\n   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4\n   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n     ```markdown\n     ---\n     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]\n     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     git_commit: [Current commit hash]\n     branch: [Current branch name]\n     repository: [Repository name]\n     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n     status: complete\n     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]\n     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]\n     ---\n\n     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]\n     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]\n     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]\n     **Repository**: [Repository name]\n\n     ## Research Question\n     [Original user query]\n\n     ## Summary\n     [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]\n\n     ## Detailed Findings\n\n     ### [Component/Area 1]\n     - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))\n     - How it connects to other components\n     - Current implementation details (without evaluation)\n\n     ### [Component/Area 2]\n     ...\n\n     ## Code References\n     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there\n     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block\n\n     ## Architecture Documentation\n     [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]\n\n     ## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n     [Relevant insights from thoughts/ directory with references]\n     - `thoughts/shared/something.md` - Historical decision about X\n     - `thoughts/local/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y\n     Note: Paths exclude \"searchable/\" even if found there\n\n     ## Related Research\n     [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]\n\n     ## Open Questions\n     [Any areas that need further investigation]\n     ```\n\n7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**\n   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`\n   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:\n     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`\n     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`\n   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document\n\n8. **Sync and present findings:**\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the thoughts directory\n   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user\n   - Include key file references for easy navigation\n   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification\n\n9. **Handle follow-up questions:**\n   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document\n   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update\n   - Add `last_updated_note: \"Added follow-up research for [brief description]\"` to frontmatter\n   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`\n   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation\n   - Continue updating the document and syncing\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage\n- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents\n- The thoughts/ directory provides historical context to supplement live findings\n- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference\n- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context\n- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations\n- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact\n- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)\n- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references\n- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading\n- Have sub-agents document examples and usage patterns as they exist\n- Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory\n- **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators\n- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE\n- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase\n- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks\n- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly\n  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)\n  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)\n  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)\n  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values\n- **Path handling**: The thoughts/searchable/ directory contains hard links for searching\n  - Always document paths by removing ONLY \"searchable/\" - preserve all other subdirectories\n  - Examples of correct transformations:\n    - `thoughts/searchable/allison/old_stuff/notes.md` → `thoughts/allison/old_stuff/notes.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/shared/prs/123.md` → `thoughts/shared/prs/123.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/global/shared/templates.md` → `thoughts/global/shared/templates.md`\n  - NEVER change allison/ to shared/ or vice versa - preserve the exact directory structure\n  - This ensures paths are correct for editing and navigation\n- **Frontmatter consistency**:\n  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents\n  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents\n  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research\n  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)\n  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"f23067f4-b68d-4913-9d34-6f0dfcc250fd","timestamp":"2025-12-27T14:33:29.672Z"}

Sans-serif for body text\n- **Geist Mono** (Google Font) - Monospace for labels and technical elements\n\n---\n\n## Pattern 1: Font Setup & Configuration\n\n### Font Loading in Layout\n**Found in**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/layout.tsx:8-26`\n\n```typescript\nconst switzer = localFont({\n  src: [\n    {\n      path: \"./fonts/Switzer-Variable.woff2\",\n      style: \"normal\",\n    },\n    {\n      path: \"./fonts/Switzer-VariableItalic.woff2\",\n      style: \"italic\",\n    },\n  ],\n  variable: \"--font-switzer\",\n  display: \"swap\",\n});\n\nconst geistMono = Geist_Mono({\n  variable: \"--font-geist-mono\",\n  subsets: [\"latin\"],\n});\n```\n\n**Applied to body**:\n```tsx\n<body className={`${switzer.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Local font files stored in `app/fonts/`\n- CSS variables `--font-switzer` and `--font-geist-mono` defined\n- Variable fonts for flexible weight control\n- `display: \"swap\"` for FOUT handling\n\n---\n\n## Pattern 2: CSS Variable Mapping\n\n### Global CSS Variables\n**Found in**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/globals.css:53-54`\n\n```css\n@theme inline {\n  --font-sans: var(--font-switzer);\n  --font-mono: var(--font-geist-mono);\n}\n\nbody {\n  font-family: var(--font-switzer), system-ui, sans-serif;\n}\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Maps Next.js font variables to Tailwind theme\n- Fallback to system fonts\n- Body tag gets Switzer by default\n- All components inherit sans-serif unless overridden\n\n---\n\n## Pattern 3: Monospace for Section Labels\n\n### Standard Section Label Pattern\n**Found throughout** - This is the most common `font-mono` usage pattern.\n\n**Example 1** - `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx:50`\n```tsx\n<span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n  How it works\n</span>\n```\n\n**Example 2** -

Sans-serif for body text\n- **Geist Mono** (Google Font) - Monospace for labels and technical elements\n\n---\n\n## Pattern 1: Font Setup & Configuration\n\n### Font Loading in Layout\n**Found in**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/layout.tsx:8-26`\n\n```typescript\nconst switzer = localFont({\n  src: [\n    {\n      path: \"./fonts/Switzer-Variable.woff2\",\n      style: \"normal\",\n    },\n    {\n      path: \"./fonts/Switzer-VariableItalic.woff2\",\n      style: \"italic\",\n    },\n  ],\n  variable: \"--font-switzer\",\n  display: \"swap\",\n});\n\nconst geistMono = Geist_Mono({\n  variable: \"--font-geist-mono\",\n  subsets: [\"latin\"],\n});\n```\n\n**Applied to body**:\n```tsx\n<body className={`${switzer.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Local font files stored in `app/fonts/`\n- CSS variables `--font-switzer` and `--font-geist-mono` defined\n- Variable fonts for flexible weight control\n- `display: \"swap\"` for FOUT handling\n\n---\n\n## Pattern 2: CSS Variable Mapping\n\n### Global CSS Variables\n**Found in**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/globals.css:53-54`\n\n```css\n@theme inline {\n  --font-sans: var(--font-switzer);\n  --font-mono: var(--font-geist-mono);\n}\n\nbody {\n  font-family: var(--font-switzer), system-ui, sans-serif;\n}\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Maps Next.js font variables to Tailwind theme\n- Fallback to system fonts\n- Body tag gets Switzer by default\n- All components inherit sans-serif unless overridden\n\n---\n\n## Pattern 3: Monospace for Section Labels\n\n### Standard Section Label Pattern\n**Found throughout** - This is the most common `font-mono` usage pattern.\n\n**Example 1** - `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx:50`\n```tsx\n<span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n  How it works\n</span>\n```\n\n**Example 2** - `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/bento/DataVaultCard.tsx:23-25`\n```tsx\n<span className=\"text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n  Unified storage\n</span>\n```\n\n**Example 3** - `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/sections/team-credentials/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx:39-41`\n```tsx\n<span className=\"bg-background px-4 text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n  Built by engineers from\n</span>\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Always `text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider`\n- Always muted colors: `text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500`\n- Used for section labels, category tags, metadata\n- Creates technical \"blueprint\" aesthetic\n\n---\n\n## Pattern 4: Monospace for Logo Wordmark\n\n### Logo Component\n**Found in**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/Logo.tsx:48-49`\n\n```tsx\n<span className=\"font-mono text-lg font-medium tracking-wide\">\n  Entourage\n</span>\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Larger size: `text-lg`\n- Medium weight: `font-medium`\n- Wider tracking than section labels\n- Pairs with LogoMark (E-block graphic)\n\n---\n\n## Pattern 5: Monospace in Footer\n\n### Footer Branding\n**Found in**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/layout/footer/Footer.tsx:28`\n\n```tsx\n<span className=\"font-mono text-sm text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">Entourage</span>\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Small size: `text-sm`\n- Muted color matching section labels\n- Reinforces technical brand identity\n\n---\n\n## Pattern 6: Monospace for Technical Labels\n\n### FlowSection AI Processing Labels\n**Found in**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx:161-228`\n\n```tsx\n{/* Desktop version */}\n<span className=\"text-sm font-mono text-black dark:text-white\">{source.label}</span>\n\n{/* AI Processing label */}\n<span className=\"text-xs font-mono text-black dark:text-white\">AI Processing</span>\n\n{/* Action badges */}\n<div className=\"... text-xs font-mono text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 ...\">\n  Extract\n</div>\n\n{/* Task destination */}\n<span className=\"text-sm font-mono text-black dark:text-white\">Your Tasks</span>\n<span className=\"mt-2 text-xs font-mono text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">You approve</span>\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Used for flow diagram labels\n- Varied sizes based on importance: `text-xs` to `text-sm`\n- Primary labels use black/white\n- Supporting text uses muted zinc colors\n- Reinforces \"technical flow\" aesthetic\n\n---\n\n## Pattern 7: Clerk Auth Integration\n\n### Clerk Appearance Configuration\n**Found in**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/layout.tsx:117`\n\n```tsx\n<ClerkProvider\n  appearance={{\n    variables: {\n      fontFamily: '\"Switzer\", -apple-system, sans-serif',\n      // ... other variables\n    },\n  }}\n>\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Auth components use Switzer to match brand\n- Fallback to `-apple-system` for native feel\n- Maintains consistency across third-party components\n\n---\n\n## Font Usage Summary\n\n| Element Type | Font Class | Pattern |\n|-------------|-----------|---------|\n| Body text (default) | Inherited `font-sans` | All components by default |\n| Section labels | `text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider` | Above sections |\n| Logo wordmark | `font-mono text-lg font-medium tracking-wide` | Header/branding |\n| Technical labels | `text-xs/text-sm font-mono` | Flow diagrams, badges |\n| Footer branding | `font-mono text-sm` | Footer copyright area |\n| Headings | Inherited `font-sans` | No explicit font class |\n| Auth forms | Inherited (via Clerk config) | Switzer via ClerkProvider |\n\n---\n\n## Design System Convention\n\n**From the design system**: Monospace font usage follows the \"Technical Blueprint\" aesthetic:\n- **Section labels**: Always uppercase, wide tracking, muted color\n- **Technical elements**: Processing states, action badges, metadata\n- **Branding**: Logo and footer for technical identity\n- **Body content**: Sans-serif (Switzer) for readability\n\n**No font-display or custom font utilities** - The codebase relies on Tailwind's `font-mono` and `font-sans` classes mapped to the CSS variables defined in layout.tsx and globals.css."}],"totalDurationMs":59007,"totalTokens":74042,"totalToolUseCount":10,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3331,"cache_read_input_tokens":68678,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3331,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2026,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

Let me look at the main landing page and the key sections to find appropriate spots.\n\nThis is a non-trivial implementation task with multiple valid approaches - I could apply `font-mono` to:\n- Certain words within headlines\n- Taglines\n- Key phrases in descriptions\n- CTA buttons\n\nI should probably enter plan mode or at least explore the codebase first to identify the best spots. But actually, the user said \"few very selected spots\" - so this is a focused task. Let me explore the main sections to find the key message parts.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":21,"cache_read_input_tokens":34549,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":21,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":6,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWXMwUofbdXYL7SqyB6rp","type":"assistant","uuid":"a88f8f28-47e6-4f5d-9447-762d2e074d12","timestamp":"2025-12-27T14:37:54.421Z"}
