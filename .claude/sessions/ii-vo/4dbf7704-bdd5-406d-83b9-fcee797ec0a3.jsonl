Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n\n2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n\n   **For codebase research:**\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)\n   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to find examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.\n\n   **For thoughts directory:**\n   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic\n   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)\n\n   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n\n   **For Linear tickets (if relevant):**\n   - Use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details of a specific ticket\n   - Use the **linear-searcher** agent to find related tickets or historical context\n\n   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings to document how they work\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n   - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving\n\n4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/allison/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n\n5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**\n   - Run the `hack/spec_metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata\n   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n     - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n       - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n       - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic\n     - Examples:\n       - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n       - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`\n\n6. **Generate research document:**\n   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4\n   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n     ```markdown\n     ---\n     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]\n     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     git_commit: [Current commit hash]\n     branch: [Current branch name]\n     repository: [Repository name]\n     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n     status: complete\n     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]\n     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]\n     ---\n\n     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]\n     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]\n     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]\n     **Repository**: [Repository name]\n\n     ## Research Question\n     [Original user query]\n\n     ## Summary\n     [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]\n\n     ## Detailed Findings\n\n     ### [Component/Area 1]\n     - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))\n     - How it connects to other components\n     - Current implementation details (without evaluation)\n\n     ### [Component/Area 2]\n     ...\n\n     ## Code References\n     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there\n     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block\n\n     ## Architecture Documentation\n     [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]\n\n     ## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n     [Relevant insights from thoughts/ directory with references]\n     - `thoughts/shared/something.md` - Historical decision about X\n     - `thoughts/local/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y\n     Note: Paths exclude \"searchable/\" even if found there\n\n     ## Related Research\n     [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]\n\n     ## Open Questions\n     [Any areas that need further investigation]\n     ```\n\n7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**\n   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`\n   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:\n     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`\n     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`\n   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document\n\n8. **Sync and present findings:**\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the thoughts directory\n   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user\n   - Include key file references for easy navigation\n   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification\n\n9. **Handle follow-up questions:**\n   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document\n   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update\n   - Add `last_updated_note: \"Added follow-up research for [brief description]\"` to frontmatter\n   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`\n   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation\n   - Continue updating the document and syncing\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage\n- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents\n- The thoughts/ directory provides historical context to supplement live findings\n- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference\n- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context\n- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations\n- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact\n- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)\n- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references\n- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading\n- Have sub-agents document examples and usage patterns as they exist\n- Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory\n- **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators\n- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE\n- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase\n- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks\n- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly\n  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)\n  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)\n  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)\n  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values\n- **Path handling**: The thoughts/searchable/ directory contains hard links for searching\n  - Always document paths by removing ONLY \"searchable/\" - preserve all other subdirectories\n  - Examples of correct transformations:\n    - `thoughts/searchable/allison/old_stuff/notes.md` → `thoughts/allison/old_stuff/notes.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/shared/prs/123.md` → `thoughts/shared/prs/123.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/global/shared/templates.md` → `thoughts/global/shared/templates.md`\n  - NEVER change allison/ to shared/ or vice versa - preserve the exact directory structure\n  - This ensures paths are correct for editing and navigation\n- **Frontmatter consistency**:\n  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents\n  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents\n  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research\n  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)\n  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied\n\n\nARGUMENTS: @src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"b3582f3b-e28d-4a3d-8e5a-8e827b6a8e5e","timestamp":"2025-12-27T10:38:09.108Z"}

It shows input sources (Meetings, Messages, Emails, Documents) connected via animated circuit lines to a central AI Processing box, which outputs to a \"Your Tasks\" element. The component uses SVG SMIL animations for circuit line draw-in effects and signal dot motion, with CSS keyframe animations for ambient UI effects like glowing badges and pulsing task arrivals.\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### Component Location\n\n**Primary File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx` (352 lines)\n\n**Directory Structure**:\n```\nsrc/components/sections/flow-section/\n├── FlowSection.tsx    # Main component\n└── index.ts           # Barrel export: export { FlowSection } from \"./FlowSection\"\n```\n\n**Re-exported via**: `src/components/sections/index.ts` (line 2)\n\n### Component Dependencies\n\n| Import | Source | Purpose |\n|--------|--------|---------|\n| `cn` | `@/lib/utils` | Tailwind class merging |\n| `Container` | `../../ui/Container` | Page-width wrapper (max-w-5xl) |\n| `Icon` | `../../Icon` | Iconify icon wrapper |\n| `LogoMark` | `../../Logo` | E-shaped Entourage logo |\n| `PlusCorner` | `../../ui/PlusCorner` | Plus sign corner decorations |\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\nThe component renders two completely separate layouts using CSS media query classes:\n- **Desktop** (`md+`): Hidden on mobile via `hidden md:block`\n- **Mobile** (`<md`): Hidden on desktop via `md:hidden`\n\nEach layout contains:\n1.

sharp corners)\n- Colors: Follows zinc scale for borders, black/white for primary text\n- Accent colors: Emerald (#10B981) for success/AI actions\n- Plus corners: Standard pattern for featured containers\n- Font: Mono for labels, standard for descriptions\n\n## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n\nMultiple research and planning documents exist for this component:\n\n- `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-flow-section-line-animations.md` -

Signal Gradient\n\n```xml\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#10B981\" />\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n```\n\nCreates a soft emerald glow effect for the signal dots.\n\n### CSS Animation System\n\nAll CSS animations defined in `src/app/globals.css`:\n\n#### `.flow-action-badge` (lines 201-245)\n\nApplied to \"Extract\" and \"Organize\" badges inside AI Processing box.\n\n**Animation**: 4s infinite color-cycling glow\n- 0%, 100%: No glow, zinc border\n- 25%: Amber glow (#F59E0B)\n- 50%: Violet glow (#8B5CF6)\n- 75%: Emerald glow (#10B981)\n\nSeparate keyframes for light (`flow-action-glow`) and dark (`flow-action-glow-dark`) modes.\n\n#### `.flow-task-arrive` (lines 248-263)\n\nApplied to \"Your Tasks\" container.\n\n**Animation**: 4s infinite pulsing ring\n- 0-70%: No shadow\n- 75%: Emerald shadow appears\n- 100%: Shadow expands to 12px and fades\n\nUses `will-change: box-shadow` for GPU optimization.\n\n#### `.flow-checkmark-bounce` (lines 265-283)\n\nApplied to the emerald checkmark badge.\n\n**Animation**: 4s infinite bounce\n- 0-70%: Scale 1\n- 80%: Scale 1.25\n- 90%: Scale 0.95 (undershoot)\n- 100%: Scale 1\n\nUses `will-change: transform` for GPU optimization.\n\n### Visual Elements\n\n#### Input Source Badges\n\n```typescript\nconst inputSources = [\n  { label: \"Meetings\", icon: \"lucide:calendar\" },\n  { label: \"Messages\", icon: \"lucide:message-square\" },\n  { label: \"Emails\", icon: \"lucide:mail\" },\n  { label: \"Documents\", icon: \"lucide:file-text\" },\n];\n```\n\nEach badge: border, icon + label, centered text.\n\n#### AI Processing Box\n\nFeatures:\n- Dashed border container\n- 4 PlusCorner decorations at corners\n- \"AI Processing\" title badge (centered above box)\n- LogoMark centered inside\n- \"Entourage\" text\n- \"Analyzes & organizes into actionable tasks\" description\n- \"Extract\" floating badge (top-left, with glow animation)\n- \"Organize\" floating badge (bottom-right, with glow animation)\n\n#### Task Output\n\nFeatures:\n- Solid border container (border-black/white)\n- Clipboard icon\n- \"Your Tasks\" label\n- Emerald checkmark badge (with bounce animation)\n- \"You approve\" caption below\n\n### Usage\n\n**Single Usage**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n- Line 5: Import from `@/components/sections`\n- Line 18: Rendered as `<FlowSection />`\n\n### Props\n\n```typescript\ninterface FlowSectionProps {\n  className?: string;\n}\n```\n\nOnly accepts optional `className` for additional styling on the root section element.\n\n## Code References\n\n- `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx:1-352` -

sharp corners)\n- Colors: Follows zinc scale for borders, black/white for primary text\n- Accent colors: Emerald (#10B981) for success/AI actions\n- Plus corners: Standard pattern for featured containers\n- Font: Mono for labels, standard for descriptions\n\n## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n\nMultiple research and planning documents exist for this component:\n\n- `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-flow-section-line-animations.md` -

Implementation Plan\n\nYou are tasked with creating detailed implementation plans through an interactive, iterative process. You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n\n    - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n    - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n    - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n\n    - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n    - Research documents\n    - Related implementation plans\n    - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n    - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n    - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n    - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**: Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n    - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n    - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n    - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n    - If a Linear ticket is mentioned, use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details\n\n    These agents will:\n\n    - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n    - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)\n    - Trace data flow and key functions\n    - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n\n    - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n    - Read them FULLY into the main context\n    - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n\n    - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n    - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n    - Note assumptions that need verification\n    - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n\n    ```\n    Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n    I've found that:\n    - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n    - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n    - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n    Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n    - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n    - [Business logic clarification]\n    - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n    ```\n\n    Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n\n    - DO NOT just accept the correction\n    - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n    - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n    - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n\n    - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n    - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n    **For deeper investigation:**\n\n    - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n    - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n    - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n    **For historical context:**\n\n    - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n    - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n    **For related tickets:**\n\n    - **linear-searcher** - To find similar issues or past implementations\n\n    Each agent knows how to:\n\n    - Find the right files and code patterns\n    - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n    - Look for integration points and dependencies\n    - Return specific file:line references\n    - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n\n    ```\n    Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n    **Current State:**\n    - [Key discovery about existing code]\n    - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n    **Design Options:**\n    1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n    2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n    **Open Questions:**\n    - [Technical uncertainty]\n    - [Design decision needed]\n\n    Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n\n    ```\n    Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n    ## Overview\n    [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n    ## Implementation Phases:\n    1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n    2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n    3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n    Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n    ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n    - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n        - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n        - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n        - description is a brief kebab-case description\n    - Examples:\n        - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n        - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-improve-error-handling.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n````markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n\n-   [Important finding with file:line reference]\n-   [Pattern to follow]\n-   [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext` **Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n-   [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n-   [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n-   [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n-   [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n-   [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n-   [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n-   [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n\n-   [What to test]\n-   [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n\n-   [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n-   Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n-   Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n-   Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n````\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n\n    - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the newly created plan\n    - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n\n    ```\n    I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n    `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n\n    Please review it and let me know:\n    - Are the phases properly scoped?\n    - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n    - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n    - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n    ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n\n    - Add missing phases\n    - Adjust technical approach\n    - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n    - Add/remove scope items\n    - After making changes, run `humanlayer thoughts sync` again\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n\n    - Question vague requirements\n    - Identify potential issues early\n    - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n    - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n\n    - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n    - Get buy-in at each major step\n    - Allow course corrections\n    - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n\n    - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n    - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n    - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n    - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n    - automated steps should use `make` whenever possible - for example `make -C humanlayer-wui check` instead of `cd humanlayer-wui && bun run fmt`\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n\n    - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n    - Consider migration and rollback\n    - Think about edge cases\n    - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n\n    - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n    - Update todos as you complete research\n    - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n    - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n    - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n    - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n    - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n    - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n\n    - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n    - Specific files that should exist\n    - Code compilation/type checking\n    - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n    - UI/UX functionality\n    - Performance under real conditions\n    - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n    - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n-   [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n-   [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n-   [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n\n-   [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n-   [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n-   [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n-   [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n\n-   Start with schema/migration\n-   Add store methods\n-   Update business logic\n-   Expose via API\n-   Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n\n-   Research existing patterns first\n-   Start with data model\n-   Build backend logic\n-   Add API endpoints\n-   Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n\n-   Document current behavior\n-   Plan incremental changes\n-   Maintain backwards compatibility\n-   Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n    - Exactly what to search for\n    - Which directories to focus on\n    - What information to extract\n    - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n    - If the ticket mentions \"WUI\", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory\n    - If it mentions \"daemon\", specify `hld/` directory\n    - Never use generic terms like \"UI\" when you mean \"WUI\"\n    - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n    - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n    - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n    - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /create_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...\n\n[Interactive process continues...]\n```\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"5b659fad-07db-466f-870c-c36d6c4ae07a","timestamp":"2025-12-27T10:42:10.672Z"}

It shows input sources (Meetings, Messages, Emails, Documents) connected via animated circuit lines to a central AI Processing box, which outputs to a \"Your Tasks\" element. The component uses SVG SMIL animations for circuit line draw-in effects and signal dot motion, with CSS keyframe animations for ambient UI effects like glowing badges and pulsing task arrivals.\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### Component Location\n\n**Primary File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx` (352 lines)\n\n**Directory Structure**:\n```\nsrc/components/sections/flow-section/\n├── FlowSection.tsx    # Main component\n└── index.ts           # Barrel export: export { FlowSection } from \"./FlowSection\"\n```\n\n**Re-exported via**: `src/components/sections/index.ts` (line 2)\n\n### Component Dependencies\n\n| Import | Source | Purpose |\n|--------|--------|---------|\n| `cn` | `@/lib/utils` | Tailwind class merging |\n| `Container` | `../../ui/Container` | Page-width wrapper (max-w-5xl) |\n| `Icon` | `../../Icon` | Iconify icon wrapper |\n| `LogoMark` | `../../Logo` | E-shaped Entourage logo |\n| `PlusCorner` | `../../ui/PlusCorner` | Plus sign corner decorations |\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\nThe component renders two completely separate layouts using CSS media query classes:\n- **Desktop** (`md+`): Hidden on mobile via `hidden md:block`\n- **Mobile** (`<md`): Hidden on desktop via `md:hidden`\n\nEach layout contains:\n1. Header text (shared content, outside fixed-aspect container)\n2. Fixed aspect-ratio container for the flow diagram\n3. SVG layer with circuit paths and animated signals\n4. Positioned HTML elements for badges and boxes\n\n### Desktop Layout (lines 64-205)\n\n**Container**: `max-w-xl aspect-[4/5]` (4:5 aspect ratio)\n**SVG ViewBox**: `0 0 400 500`\n\n**Path Coordinates** (defined at lines 27-32):\n```typescript\nconst desktopPaths = [\n  \"M 50 30 v 30 q 0 8 8 8 h 134 q 8 0 8 8 v 324\",   // Left outer\n  \"M 150 30 v 30 q 0 8 8 8 h 34 q 8 0 8 8 v 324\",   // Left inner\n  \"M 250 30 v 30 q 0 8 -8 8 h -34 q -8 0 -8 8 v 324\", // Right inner\n  \"M 350 30 v 30 q 0 8 -8 8 h -134 q -8 0 -8 8 v 324\", // Right outer\n];\n```\n\n**Input Badges**: 4-column grid at `top: 2%`\n**AI Processing Box**: Centered at `top: 22%`, `height: 40%`, `width: 65%`\n**Task Output**: Centered at `top: 80%`\n\n### Mobile Layout (lines 207-347)\n\n**Container**: `max-w-xs aspect-[3/5]` (3:5 aspect ratio)\n**SVG ViewBox**: `0 0 300 500`\n\n**Path Coordinates** (defined at lines 37-42):\n```typescript\nconst mobilePaths = [\n  \"M 75 28 v 62 q 0 8 8 8 h 59 q 8 0 8 8 v 304\",    // Row 1 left\n  \"M 225 28 v 62 q 0 8 -8 8 h -59 q -8 0 -8 8 v 304\", // Row 1 right\n  \"M 75 88 v 2 q 0 8 8 8 h 59 q 8 0 8 8 v 304\",     // Row 2 left\n  \"M 225 88 v 2 q 0 8 -8 8 h -59 q -8 0 -8 8 v 304\",  // Row 2 right\n];\n```\n\n**Input Badges**: 2x2 grid at `top: 2%`\n**AI Processing Box**: Centered at `top: 28%`, `height: 38%`, `width: 80%`\n**Task Output**: Centered at `top: 82%`\n\n### SVG Animation System\n\n#### 1. Path Draw-In Animation (SMIL)\n\nEach circuit path uses `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` for a draw-in effect:\n\n```xml\n<path d={pathData}>\n  <animate\n    attributeName=\"stroke-dashoffset\"\n    from=\"800\" to=\"0\"\n    dur=\"1.5s\"\n    fill=\"freeze\"\n    calcMode=\"spline\"\n    keySplines=\"0.25,0.1,0.5,1\"\n    keyTimes=\"0; 1\"\n  />\n</path>\n```\n\n- **Duration**: 1.5s\n- **Easing**: Spline with ease-out feel\n- **Fill**: `freeze` (stays at final state)\n\n#### 2. Signal Dot Motion (SMIL)\n\nAnimated circles follow paths using `<animateMotion>`:\n\n```xml\n<circle r=\"8\" fill=\"url(#flow-signal-gradient)\">\n  <animateMotion\n    path={pathData}\n    dur={`${3.5 + i * 0.5}s`}\n    begin={`${1.5 + i * 0.3}s`}\n    repeatCount=\"indefinite\"\n    calcMode=\"spline\"\n    keySplines=\"0.4 0 0.2 1\"\n    keyTimes=\"0;1\"\n  />\n  <animate\n    attributeName=\"opacity\"\n    values=\"0;1;1;0\"\n    keyTimes=\"0;0.1;0.9;1\"\n    dur={`${3.5 + i * 0.5}s`}\n    begin={`${1.5 + i * 0.3}s`}\n    repeatCount=\"indefinite\"\n  />\n</circle>\n```\n\n- **Duration**: 3.5s to 5s (staggered per path)\n- **Begin**: 1.5s to 2.4s (starts after draw-in)\n- **Opacity**: Fades in at 10%, fades out at 90%\n- **Masking**: Each signal is masked to its path via `<mask>` elements\n\n#### 3. Signal Gradient\n\n```xml\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#10B981\" />\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n```\n\nCreates a soft emerald glow effect for the signal dots.\n\n### CSS Animation System\n\nAll CSS animations defined in `src/app/globals.css`:\n\n#### `.flow-action-badge` (lines 201-245)\n\nApplied to \"Extract\" and \"Organize\" badges inside AI Processing box.\n\n**Animation**: 4s infinite color-cycling glow\n- 0%, 100%: No glow, zinc border\n- 25%: Amber glow (#F59E0B)\n- 50%: Violet glow (#8B5CF6)\n- 75%: Emerald glow (#10B981)\n\nSeparate keyframes for light (`flow-action-glow`) and dark (`flow-action-glow-dark`) modes.\n\n#### `.flow-task-arrive` (lines 248-263)\n\nApplied to \"Your Tasks\" container.\n\n**Animation**: 4s infinite pulsing ring\n- 0-70%: No shadow\n- 75%: Emerald shadow appears\n- 100%: Shadow expands to 12px and fades\n\nUses `will-change: box-shadow` for GPU optimization.\n\n#### `.flow-checkmark-bounce` (lines 265-283)\n\nApplied to the emerald checkmark badge.\n\n**Animation**: 4s infinite bounce\n- 0-70%: Scale 1\n- 80%: Scale 1.25\n- 90%: Scale 0.95 (undershoot)\n- 100%: Scale 1\n\nUses `will-change: transform` for GPU optimization.\n\n### Visual Elements\n\n#### Input Source Badges\n\n```typescript\nconst inputSources = [\n  { label: \"Meetings\", icon: \"lucide:calendar\" },\n  { label: \"Messages\", icon: \"lucide:message-square\" },\n  { label: \"Emails\", icon: \"lucide:mail\" },\n  { label: \"Documents\", icon: \"lucide:file-text\" },\n];\n```\n\nEach badge: border, icon + label, centered text.\n\n#### AI Processing Box\n\nFeatures:\n- Dashed border container\n- 4 PlusCorner decorations at corners\n- \"AI Processing\" title badge (centered above box)\n- LogoMark centered inside\n- \"Entourage\" text\n- \"Analyzes & organizes into actionable tasks\" description\n- \"Extract\" floating badge (top-left, with glow animation)\n- \"Organize\" floating badge (bottom-right, with glow animation)\n\n#### Task Output\n\nFeatures:\n- Solid border container (border-black/white)\n- Clipboard icon\n- \"Your Tasks\" label\n- Emerald checkmark badge (with bounce animation)\n- \"You approve\" caption below\n\n### Usage\n\n**Single Usage**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n- Line 5: Import from `@/components/sections`\n- Line 18: Rendered as `<FlowSection />`\n\n### Props\n\n```typescript\ninterface FlowSectionProps {\n  className?: string;\n}\n```\n\nOnly accepts optional `className` for additional styling on the root section element.\n\n## Code References\n\n- `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx:1-352` -

PlusCorner component\n\n## Architecture Documentation\n\n### Animation Timing Coordination\n\nAll animations are synchronized on 4-second cycles:\n- **SVG signals**: 3.5-5s duration, staggered starts\n- **Action badge glow**: 4s cycle through 3 colors\n- **Task pulse**: 4s cycle, triggers at 75%\n- **Checkmark bounce**: 4s cycle, triggers at 70-100%\n\nThe task pulse and checkmark bounce are intentionally aligned to trigger together, creating a \"task arrival\" visual event.\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\nRather than using CSS transforms or JavaScript for responsive paths, the component renders two complete layouts:\n- Simplifies path coordinate management\n- Each layout optimized for its screen size\n- No runtime calculations needed\n\n### Design System Compliance\n\n- Border radius: `rounded-none` (none used - sharp corners)\n- Colors: Follows zinc scale for borders, black/white for primary text\n- Accent colors: Emerald (#10B981) for success/AI actions\n- Plus corners: Standard pattern for featured containers\n- Font: Mono for labels, standard for descriptions\n\n## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n\nMultiple research and planning documents exist for this component:\n\n- `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-flow-section-line-animations.md` - Previous research on line animation implementation\n- `thoughts/shared/plans/2025-12-27-flowsection-smooth-animations.md` - Plan for smooth animation improvements\n- `thoughts/shared/plans/2025-12-26-flowsection-animated-signals.md` -

Match the \"sharp\" aesthetic of the existing task pulse.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Signal Color Gradient Transition\n\n### Overview\n\nChange signal dots from static emerald to animated amber→emerald gradient as they travel along paths.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. SVG Gradient Definition\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**Lines 71-76** - Replace static gradient with animated gradient:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#10B981\" />\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n\n{/* New - Animated gradient */}\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#F59E0B\">\n    <animate\n      attributeName=\"stop-color\"\n      values=\"#F59E0B;#F59E0B;#10B981;#10B981\"\n      keyTimes=\"0;0.3;0.7;1\"\n      dur=\"4s\"\n      repeatCount=\"indefinite\"\n    />\n  </stop>\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n```\n\n**Timing Rationale**:\n- 0-30%: Amber (signal departing input)\n- 30-70%: Transition (signal in AI box)\n- 70-100%: Emerald (signal approaching output)\n\n#### 2. Mobile Gradient (Same Change)\n\n**Lines 219-222** - Apply identical change to mobile gradient `flow-signal-gradient-mobile`.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Signal dots start amber when leaving input badges\n- [ ] Signal dots transition to emerald as they reach AI box\n- [ ] Color transition is smooth, not jarring\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n- [ ] Mobile layout shows same color transition\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 2.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Action Badge Pulse Animation\n\n### Overview\n\nReplace color-cycling glow with a sharp \"scan line\" pulse that fires when signals pass through the AI box. More technical, blueprint-feeling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. New CSS Keyframes\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Replace lines 200-245** with:\n\n```css\n/* FlowSection Action Badge - Technical scan pulse */\n.flow-action-badge {\n  will-change: box-shadow, border-color;\n  animation: flow-action-pulse 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes flow-action-pulse {\n  0%, 60% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(228 228 231); /* zinc-200 */\n  }\n  65% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.6), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.4);\n    border-color: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.8);\n  }\n  75% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.6), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.4);\n    border-color: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.8);\n  }\n  85%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(228 228 231); /* zinc-200 */\n  }\n}\n\n.dark .flow-action-badge {\n  animation: flow-action-pulse-dark 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes flow-action-pulse-dark {\n  0%, 60% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(63 63 70); /* zinc-700 */\n  }\n  65% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.5), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.3);\n    border-color: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.7);\n  }\n  75% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.5), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.3);\n    border-color: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.7);\n  }\n  85%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(63 63 70); /* zinc-700 */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Animation Design**:\n- Sharp pulse instead of smooth glow cycling\n- Amber flash (65%) → Emerald flash (75%) → Rest\n- Matches the \"data processed\" moment\n- Inset shadow creates technical \"scan\" effect\n- Synchronized with task arrival at 75%\n\n#### 2. Staggered Animation Delays for Each Badge\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\nAdd animation delay classes to create sequence:\n\n**Desktop \"Extract\" badge (line 180)**:\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute top-3 left-3 ...\">\n\n{/* New - add inline style for delay */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute top-3 left-3 ...\" style={{ animationDelay: '0s' }}>\n```\n\n**Desktop \"Organize\" badge (line 184)**:\n```tsx\n{/* Add delay */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-3 right-3 ...\" style={{ animationDelay: '0.3s' }}>\n```\n\nSame pattern for mobile badges (lines 322, 326).\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Action badges pulse sharply (not gradual glow)\n- [ ] Pulse shows amber→emerald color sequence\n- [ ] Badges pulse in staggered sequence\n- [ ] Animation feels \"technical\" and matches task arrival\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add \"Analyze\" Badge\n\n### Overview\n\nAdd third action badge \"Analyze\" at bottom-left of AI Processing box to complete the triad: Extract → Analyze → Organize.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Desktop Layout\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**After line 187** (after the Organize badge), add:\n\n```tsx\n<div\n  className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-3 left-3 border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background px-2 py-1 text-xs font-mono text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 flex items-center gap-1\"\n  style={{ animationDelay: '0.15s' }}\n>\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:scan-search\" size={12} />\n  <span>Analyze</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Icon choice**: `lucide:scan-search` - represents data analysis/scanning. Alternatives: `lucide:search-code`, `lucide:microscope`.\n\n**Animation delay**: 0.15s (between Extract at 0s and Organize at 0.3s) for sequential pulse effect.\n\n#### 2. Mobile Layout\n\n**After line 329** (after mobile Organize badge), add:\n\n```tsx\n<div\n  className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-2 left-2 border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background px-1.5 py-0.5 text-[10px] font-mono text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 flex items-center gap-1\"\n  style={{ animationDelay: '0.15s' }}\n>\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:scan-search\" size={10} />\n  <span>Analyze</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] \"Analyze\" badge visible at bottom-left of AI box\n- [ ] Badge matches styling of Extract/Organize\n- [ ] Badge pulses in sequence: Extract → Analyze → Organize\n- [ ] Mobile layout shows badge correctly scaled\n- [ ] Badge doesn't overlap with other elements\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 4.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Input Source Pulse Animation\n\n### Overview\n\nAdd amber pulse animation to input badges (Meetings, Messages, Emails, Documents) that fires when signals depart.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. New CSS Animation\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Add after line 283** (after flow-checkmark-bounce):\n\n```css\n/* FlowSection Input Source - departure pulse */\n.flow-input-source {\n  will-change: box-shadow;\n  animation: flow-input-pulse 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Staggered delays for each input */\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.6s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.9s; }\n\n@keyframes flow-input-pulse {\n  0%, 5% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n  10% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.5);\n  }\n  20% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0);\n  }\n  25%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n}\n\n.dark .flow-input-source {\n  animation: flow-input-pulse-dark 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Staggered delays preserved in dark mode */\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.6s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.9s; }\n\n@keyframes flow-input-pulse-dark {\n  0%, 5% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n  10% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.4);\n  }\n  20% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0);\n  }\n  25%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Animation Design**:\n- Quick amber ring pulse (like signal departing)\n- Fires at start of cycle (0-20%)\n- Staggered by 0.3s to match signal stagger\n- Matches the expanding ring style of task arrival (but amber)\n\n#### 2. Apply Class to Input Badges\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**Desktop input badges (lines 140-148)**:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n{inputSources.map((source) => (\n  <div\n    key={source.label}\n    className=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-2 py-2.5 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background\"\n  >\n\n{/* New - add flow-input-source class */}\n{inputSources.map((source) => (\n  <div\n    key={source.label}\n    className=\"flow-input-source flex items-center justify-center gap-2 py-2.5 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background\"\n  >\n```\n\n**Mobile input badges (lines 286-294)** - Same change, add `flow-input-source` class.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Input badges pulse amber at start of animation cycle\n- [ ] Pulses are staggered (each badge pulses at different time)\n- [ ] Ring expands outward (matches task arrival style)\n- [ ] Animation syncs with signal departure timing\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, verify the complete animation sequence flows correctly from inputs → AI box → output.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\nN/A - Visual animations, no logic to unit test.\n\n### Integration Tests\nN/A - CSS/SVG animations.\n\n### Manual Testing Steps\n\n1. **Full flow test**: Watch complete animation cycle (4s)\n   - Input badges pulse amber (0-0.5s staggered)\n   - Signals travel from inputs, transitioning amber→emerald\n   - Action badges pulse amber→emerald as signals pass (2.5-3.5s)\n   - Task output pulses emerald, checkmark bounces (3s)\n\n2. **Dark mode test**: Toggle theme, verify all animations work\n\n3. **Mobile test**: Resize to mobile, verify layout and timing\n\n4. **Reduced motion test**: Enable `prefers-reduced-motion`, verify animations are disabled/reduced\n\n5. **Performance test**: Check for jank using Chrome DevTools Performance tab\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- All animations use GPU-optimized properties (`transform`, `box-shadow`, `opacity`)\n- `will-change` hints added for box-shadow animations\n- No JavaScript animation overhead\n- Animations are CSS/SVG declarative (browser-optimized)\n\n## Accessibility\n\n- Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query\n- Colors are not the only indicator (shape, position, labels all provide context)\n- Animation timing is slow enough to not cause discomfort (4s cycle)\n\n## References\n\n- Research: `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-flow-section-component.md`\n- Design system: `docs/design-system.md` (Accent colors: Amber #F59E0B, Emerald #10B981)\n- Component: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n- Styles: `src/app/globals.css:200-283`\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":188,"cache_read_input_tokens":79983,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":188,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4816,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWX4DbXLMdtt27M3DCwwb","type":"assistant","uuid":"5b286c5c-63a4-40ed-8664-7ebe4cab5840","timestamp":"2025-12-27T10:46:28.846Z"}

SVG Gradient Definition\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**Lines 71-76** - Replace static gradient with animated gradient:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#10B981\" />\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n\n{/* New - Animated gradient */}\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#F59E0B\">\n    <animate\n      attributeName=\"stop-color\"\n      values=\"#F59E0B;#F59E0B;#10B981;#10B981\"\n      keyTimes=\"0;0.3;0.7;1\"\n      dur=\"4s\"\n      repeatCount=\"indefinite\"\n    />\n  </stop>\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n```\n\n**Timing Rationale**:\n- 0-30%: Amber (signal departing input)\n- 30-70%: Transition (signal in AI box)\n- 70-100%: Emerald (signal approaching output)\n\n#### 2. Mobile Gradient (Same Change)\n\n**Lines 219-222** - Apply identical change to mobile gradient `flow-signal-gradient-mobile`.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Signal dots start amber when leaving input badges\n- [ ] Signal dots transition to emerald as they reach AI box\n- [ ] Color transition is smooth, not jarring\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n- [ ] Mobile layout shows same color transition\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 2.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Action Badge Pulse Animation\n\n### Overview\n\nReplace color-cycling glow with a sharp \"scan line\" pulse that fires when signals pass through the AI box. More technical, blueprint-feeling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. New CSS Keyframes\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Replace lines 200-245** with:\n\n```css\n/* FlowSection Action Badge - Technical scan pulse */\n.flow-action-badge {\n  will-change: box-shadow, border-color;\n  animation: flow-action-pulse 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes flow-action-pulse {\n  0%, 60% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(228 228 231); /* zinc-200 */\n  }\n  65% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.6), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.4);\n    border-color: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.8);\n  }\n  75% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.6), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.4);\n    border-color: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.8);\n  }\n  85%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(228 228 231); /* zinc-200 */\n  }\n}\n\n.dark .flow-action-badge {\n  animation: flow-action-pulse-dark 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes flow-action-pulse-dark {\n  0%, 60% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(63 63 70); /* zinc-700 */\n  }\n  65% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.5), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.3);\n    border-color: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.7);\n  }\n  75% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.5), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.3);\n    border-color: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.7);\n  }\n  85%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(63 63 70); /* zinc-700 */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Animation Design**:\n- Sharp pulse instead of smooth glow cycling\n- Amber flash (65%) → Emerald flash (75%) → Rest\n- Matches the \"data processed\" moment\n- Inset shadow creates technical \"scan\" effect\n- Synchronized with task arrival at 75%\n\n#### 2. Staggered Animation Delays for Each Badge\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\nAdd animation delay classes to create sequence:\n\n**Desktop \"Extract\" badge (line 180)**:\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute top-3 left-3 ...\">\n\n{/* New - add inline style for delay */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute top-3 left-3 ...\" style={{ animationDelay: '0s' }}>\n```\n\n**Desktop \"Organize\" badge (line 184)**:\n```tsx\n{/* Add delay */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-3 right-3 ...\" style={{ animationDelay: '0.3s' }}>\n```\n\nSame pattern for mobile badges (lines 322, 326).\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Action badges pulse sharply (not gradual glow)\n- [ ] Pulse shows amber→emerald color sequence\n- [ ] Badges pulse in staggered sequence\n- [ ] Animation feels \"technical\" and matches task arrival\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add \"Analyze\" Badge\n\n### Overview\n\nAdd third action badge \"Analyze\" at bottom-left of AI Processing box to complete the triad: Extract → Analyze → Organize.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Desktop Layout\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**After line 187** (after the Organize badge), add:\n\n```tsx\n<div\n  className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-3 left-3 border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background px-2 py-1 text-xs font-mono text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 flex items-center gap-1\"\n  style={{ animationDelay: '0.15s' }}\n>\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:scan-search\" size={12} />\n  <span>Analyze</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Icon choice**: `lucide:scan-search` - represents data analysis/scanning. Alternatives: `lucide:search-code`, `lucide:microscope`.\n\n**Animation delay**: 0.15s (between Extract at 0s and Organize at 0.3s) for sequential pulse effect.\n\n#### 2. Mobile Layout\n\n**After line 329** (after mobile Organize badge), add:\n\n```tsx\n<div\n  className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-2 left-2 border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background px-1.5 py-0.5 text-[10px] font-mono text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 flex items-center gap-1\"\n  style={{ animationDelay: '0.15s' }}\n>\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:scan-search\" size={10} />\n  <span>Analyze</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] \"Analyze\" badge visible at bottom-left of AI box\n- [ ] Badge matches styling of Extract/Organize\n- [ ] Badge pulses in sequence: Extract → Analyze → Organize\n- [ ] Mobile layout shows badge correctly scaled\n- [ ] Badge doesn't overlap with other elements\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 4.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Input Source Pulse Animation\n\n### Overview\n\nAdd amber pulse animation to input badges (Meetings, Messages, Emails, Documents) that fires when signals depart.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. New CSS Animation\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Add after line 283** (after flow-checkmark-bounce):\n\n```css\n/* FlowSection Input Source - departure pulse */\n.flow-input-source {\n  will-change: box-shadow;\n  animation: flow-input-pulse 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Staggered delays for each input */\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.6s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.9s; }\n\n@keyframes flow-input-pulse {\n  0%, 5% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n  10% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.5);\n  }\n  20% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0);\n  }\n  25%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n}\n\n.dark .flow-input-source {\n  animation: flow-input-pulse-dark 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Staggered delays preserved in dark mode */\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.6s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.9s; }\n\n@keyframes flow-input-pulse-dark {\n  0%, 5% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n  10% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.4);\n  }\n  20% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0);\n  }\n  25%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Animation Design**:\n- Quick amber ring pulse (like signal departing)\n- Fires at start of cycle (0-20%)\n- Staggered by 0.3s to match signal stagger\n- Matches the expanding ring style of task arrival (but amber)\n\n#### 2. Apply Class to Input Badges\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**Desktop input badges (lines 140-148)**:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n{inputSources.map((source) => (\n  <div\n    key={source.label}\n    className=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-2 py-2.5 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background\"\n  >\n\n{/* New - add flow-input-source class */}\n{inputSources.map((source) => (\n  <div\n    key={source.label}\n    className=\"flow-input-source flex items-center justify-center gap-2 py-2.5 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background\"\n  >\n```\n\n**Mobile input badges (lines 286-294)** - Same change, add `flow-input-source` class.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Input badges pulse amber at start of animation cycle\n- [ ] Pulses are staggered (each badge pulses at different time)\n- [ ] Ring expands outward (matches task arrival style)\n- [ ] Animation syncs with signal departure timing\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, verify the complete animation sequence flows correctly from inputs → AI box → output.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\nN/A - Visual animations, no logic to unit test.\n\n### Integration Tests\nN/A - CSS/SVG animations.\n\n### Manual Testing Steps\n\n1. **Full flow test**: Watch complete animation cycle (4s)\n   - Input badges pulse amber (0-0.5s staggered)\n   - Signals travel from inputs, transitioning amber→emerald\n   - Action badges pulse amber→emerald as signals pass (2.5-3.5s)\n   - Task output pulses emerald, checkmark bounces (3s)\n\n2. **Dark mode test**: Toggle theme, verify all animations work\n\n3. **Mobile test**: Resize to mobile, verify layout and timing\n\n4. **Reduced motion test**: Enable `prefers-reduced-motion`, verify animations are disabled/reduced\n\n5. **Performance test**: Check for jank using Chrome DevTools Performance tab\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- All animations use GPU-optimized properties (`transform`, `box-shadow`, `opacity`)\n- `will-change` hints added for box-shadow animations\n- No JavaScript animation overhead\n- Animations are CSS/SVG declarative (browser-optimized)\n\n## Accessibility\n\n- Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query\n- Colors are not the only indicator (shape, position, labels all provide context)\n- Animation timing is slow enough to not cause discomfort (4s cycle)\n\n## References\n\n- Research: `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-flow-section-component.md`\n- Design system: `docs/design-system.md` (Accent colors: Amber #F59E0B, Emerald #10B981)\n- Component: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n- Styles: `src/app/globals.css:200-283`\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n- **Pause for human verification**: After completing all automated verification for a phase, pause and inform the human that the phase is ready for manual testing. Use this format:\n  ```\n  Phase [N] Complete - Ready for Manual Verification\n\n  Automated verification passed:\n  - [List automated checks that passed]\n\n  Please perform the manual verification steps listed in the plan:\n  - [List manual verification items from the plan]\n\n  Let me know when manual testing is complete so I can proceed to Phase [N+1].\n  ```\n\nIf instructed to execute multiple phases consecutively, skip the pause until the last phase. Otherwise, assume you are just doing one phase.\n\ndo not check off items in the manual testing steps until confirmed by the user.\n\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"72621ecf-6345-4ebf-b5b1-8e452eff71d1","timestamp":"2025-12-27T11:06:53.864Z"}

Replace the color-cycling glow on action badges with a technical pulse animation that matches the \"Your Tasks\" arrival effect. Add a third \"Analyze\" badge and input source departure animations.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### What Exists Now\n\n**Signal Dots** (`globals.css`, `FlowSection.tsx:71-76, 110-132`):\n- Static emerald radial gradient (`#10B981`)\n- Dots animate along paths via SMIL `<animateMotion>`\n- Fade in/out at path endpoints\n\n**Action Badges** (`globals.css:201-245`, `FlowSection.tsx:180-187`):\n- Two badges: \"Extract\" (top-left) and \"Organize\" (bottom-right)\n- 4s color-cycling glow: zinc → amber → violet → emerald\n- Different keyframes for light/dark modes\n\n**Task Arrival** (`globals.css:248-283`):\n- Pulsing emerald ring expanding outward\n- Checkmark bounce animation\n- Both on 4s cycle, trigger at 70-75%\n\n**Input Badges** (`FlowSection.tsx:136-149, 282-295`):\n- Static badges with border and icon\n- No animation currently\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n- All animations use 4s base cycle for synchronization\n- Signal duration: 3.5-5s per path (staggered)\n- Signal begin time: 1.5s + (index * 0.3s)\n- Task pulse triggers at 75% of cycle (3s mark)\n\n## Desired End State\n\n1. **Signal dots** transition from amber glow at start to emerald glow at end\n2. **Action badges** (Extract, Analyze, Organize) pulse with a sharp \"scan line\" effect synchronized with signal arrival, matching the technical blueprint aesthetic\n3. **Input badges** emit a brief amber pulse when signals depart\n4. Visual narrative: amber (pending) → processing → emerald (complete)\n\n### Verification\n\n- Visual: Signals clearly show color transition along path\n- Visual: Action badges pulse in rhythm with signals passing through\n- Visual: Input badges flash amber as signals leave\n- Technical: All animations remain GPU-optimized\n- Accessibility: Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Changing the path draw-in animation (works well)\n- Modifying the task arrival pulse (already good)\n- Changing signal timing/duration\n- Adding JavaScript-based animations (keeping CSS/SVG only)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nUse SVG gradient animation for color transitions and CSS keyframes for badge pulses. Keep all timing synchronized on 4s cycles. Match the \"sharp\" aesthetic of the existing task pulse.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Signal Color Gradient Transition\n\n### Overview\n\nChange signal dots from static emerald to animated amber→emerald gradient as they travel along paths.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

Mobile Gradient (Same Change)\n\n**Lines 219-222** - Apply identical change to mobile gradient `flow-signal-gradient-mobile`.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Signal dots start amber when leaving input badges\n- [ ] Signal dots transition to emerald as they reach AI box\n- [ ] Color transition is smooth, not jarring\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n- [ ] Mobile layout shows same color transition\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 2.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Action Badge Pulse Animation\n\n### Overview\n\nReplace color-cycling glow with a sharp \"scan line\" pulse that fires when signals pass through the AI box. More technical, blueprint-feeling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. New CSS Keyframes\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Replace lines 200-245** with:\n\n```css\n/* FlowSection Action Badge - Technical scan pulse */\n.flow-action-badge {\n  will-change: box-shadow, border-color;\n  animation: flow-action-pulse 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes flow-action-pulse {\n  0%, 60% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(228 228 231); /* zinc-200 */\n  }\n  65% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.6), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.4);\n    border-color: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.8);\n  }\n  75% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.6), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.4);\n    border-color: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.8);\n  }\n  85%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(228 228 231); /* zinc-200 */\n  }\n}\n\n.dark .flow-action-badge {\n  animation: flow-action-pulse-dark 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes flow-action-pulse-dark {\n  0%, 60% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(63 63 70); /* zinc-700 */\n  }\n  65% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.5), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.3);\n    border-color: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.7);\n  }\n  75% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.5), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.3);\n    border-color: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.7);\n  }\n  85%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(63 63 70); /* zinc-700 */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Animation Design**:\n- Sharp pulse instead of smooth glow cycling\n- Amber flash (65%) → Emerald flash (75%) → Rest\n- Matches the \"data processed\" moment\n- Inset shadow creates technical \"scan\" effect\n- Synchronized with task arrival at 75%\n\n#### 2. Staggered Animation Delays for Each Badge\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\nAdd animation delay classes to create sequence:\n\n**Desktop \"Extract\" badge (line 180)**:\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute top-3 left-3 ...\">\n\n{/* New - add inline style for delay */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute top-3 left-3 ...\" style={{ animationDelay: '0s' }}>\n```\n\n**Desktop \"Organize\" badge (line 184)**:\n```tsx\n{/* Add delay */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-3 right-3 ...\" style={{ animationDelay: '0.3s' }}>\n```\n\nSame pattern for mobile badges (lines 322, 326).\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Action badges pulse sharply (not gradual glow)\n- [ ] Pulse shows amber→emerald color sequence\n- [ ] Badges pulse in staggered sequence\n- [ ] Animation feels \"technical\" and matches task arrival\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add \"Analyze\" Badge\n\n### Overview\n\nAdd third action badge \"Analyze\" at bottom-left of AI Processing box to complete the triad: Extract → Analyze → Organize.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Desktop Layout\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**After line 187** (after the Organize badge), add:\n\n```tsx\n<div\n  className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-3 left-3 border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background px-2 py-1 text-xs font-mono text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 flex items-center gap-1\"\n  style={{ animationDelay: '0.15s' }}\n>\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:scan-search\" size={12} />\n  <span>Analyze</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Icon choice**: `lucide:scan-search` - represents data analysis/scanning. Alternatives: `lucide:search-code`, `lucide:microscope`.\n\n**Animation delay**: 0.15s (between Extract at 0s and Organize at 0.3s) for sequential pulse effect.\n\n#### 2. Mobile Layout\n\n**After line 329** (after mobile Organize badge), add:\n\n```tsx\n<div\n  className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-2 left-2 border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background px-1.5 py-0.5 text-[10px] font-mono text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 flex items-center gap-1\"\n  style={{ animationDelay: '0.15s' }}\n>\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:scan-search\" size={10} />\n  <span>Analyze</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] \"Analyze\" badge visible at bottom-left of AI box\n- [ ] Badge matches styling of Extract/Organize\n- [ ] Badge pulses in sequence: Extract → Analyze → Organize\n- [ ] Mobile layout shows badge correctly scaled\n- [ ] Badge doesn't overlap with other elements\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 4.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Input Source Pulse Animation\n\n### Overview\n\nAdd amber pulse animation to input badges (Meetings, Messages, Emails, Documents) that fires when signals depart.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. New CSS Animation\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Add after line 283** (after flow-checkmark-bounce):\n\n```css\n/* FlowSection Input Source - departure pulse */\n.flow-input-source {\n  will-change: box-shadow;\n  animation: flow-input-pulse 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Staggered delays for each input */\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.6s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.9s; }\n\n@keyframes flow-input-pulse {\n  0%, 5% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n  10% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.5);\n  }\n  20% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0);\n  }\n  25%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n}\n\n.dark .flow-input-source {\n  animation: flow-input-pulse-dark 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Staggered delays preserved in dark mode */\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.6s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.9s; }\n\n@keyframes flow-input-pulse-dark {\n  0%, 5% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n  10% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.4);\n  }\n  20% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0);\n  }\n  25%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Animation Design**:\n- Quick amber ring pulse (like signal departing)\n- Fires at start of cycle (0-20%)\n- Staggered by 0.3s to match signal stagger\n- Matches the expanding ring style of task arrival (but amber)\n\n#### 2. Apply Class to Input Badges\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**Desktop input badges (lines 140-148)**:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n{inputSources.map((source) => (\n  <div\n    key={source.label}\n    className=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-2 py-2.5 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background\"\n  >\n\n{/* New - add flow-input-source class */}\n{inputSources.map((source) => (\n  <div\n    key={source.label}\n    className=\"flow-input-source flex items-center justify-center gap-2 py-2.5 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background\"\n  >\n```\n\n**Mobile input badges (lines 286-294)** - Same change, add `flow-input-source` class.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Input badges pulse amber at start of animation cycle\n- [ ] Pulses are staggered (each badge pulses at different time)\n- [ ] Ring expands outward (matches task arrival style)\n- [ ] Animation syncs with signal departure timing\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, verify the complete animation sequence flows correctly from inputs → AI box → output.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\nN/A - Visual animations, no logic to unit test.\n\n### Integration Tests\nN/A - CSS/SVG animations.\n\n### Manual Testing Steps\n\n1. **Full flow test**: Watch complete animation cycle (4s)\n   - Input badges pulse amber (0-0.5s staggered)\n   - Signals travel from inputs, transitioning amber→emerald\n   - Action badges pulse amber→emerald as signals pass (2.5-3.5s)\n   - Task output pulses emerald, checkmark bounces (3s)\n\n2. **Dark mode test**: Toggle theme, verify all animations work\n\n3. **Mobile test**: Resize to mobile, verify layout and timing\n\n4. **Reduced motion test**: Enable `prefers-reduced-motion`, verify animations are disabled/reduced\n\n5. **Performance test**: Check for jank using Chrome DevTools Performance tab\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- All animations use GPU-optimized properties (`transform`, `box-shadow`, `opacity`)\n- `will-change` hints added for box-shadow animations\n- No JavaScript animation overhead\n- Animations are CSS/SVG declarative (browser-optimized)\n\n## Accessibility\n\n- Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query\n- Colors are not the only indicator (shape, position, labels all provide context)\n- Animation timing is slow enough to not cause discomfort (4s cycle)\n\n## References\n\n- Research: `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-flow-section-component.md`\n- Design system: `docs/design-system.md` (Accent colors: Amber #F59E0B, Emerald #10B981)\n- Component: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n- Styles: `src/app/globals.css:200-283`\n","numLines":459,"startLine":1,"totalLines":459}}}

Replace the color-cycling glow on action badges with a technical pulse animation that matches the \"Your Tasks\" arrival effect. Add a third \"Analyze\" badge and input source departure animations.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### What Exists Now\n\n**Signal Dots** (`globals.css`, `FlowSection.tsx:71-76, 110-132`):\n- Static emerald radial gradient (`#10B981`)\n- Dots animate along paths via SMIL `<animateMotion>`\n- Fade in/out at path endpoints\n\n**Action Badges** (`globals.css:201-245`, `FlowSection.tsx:180-187`):\n- Two badges: \"Extract\" (top-left) and \"Organize\" (bottom-right)\n- 4s color-cycling glow: zinc → amber → violet → emerald\n- Different keyframes for light/dark modes\n\n**Task Arrival** (`globals.css:248-283`):\n- Pulsing emerald ring expanding outward\n- Checkmark bounce animation\n- Both on 4s cycle, trigger at 70-75%\n\n**Input Badges** (`FlowSection.tsx:136-149, 282-295`):\n- Static badges with border and icon\n- No animation currently\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n- All animations use 4s base cycle for synchronization\n- Signal duration: 3.5-5s per path (staggered)\n- Signal begin time: 1.5s + (index * 0.3s)\n- Task pulse triggers at 75% of cycle (3s mark)\n\n## Desired End State\n\n1. **Signal dots** transition from amber glow at start to emerald glow at end\n2. **Action badges** (Extract, Analyze, Organize) pulse with a sharp \"scan line\" effect synchronized with signal arrival, matching the technical blueprint aesthetic\n3. **Input badges** emit a brief amber pulse when signals depart\n4. Visual narrative: amber (pending) → processing → emerald (complete)\n\n### Verification\n\n- Visual: Signals clearly show color transition along path\n- Visual: Action badges pulse in rhythm with signals passing through\n- Visual: Input badges flash amber as signals leave\n- Technical: All animations remain GPU-optimized\n- Accessibility: Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Changing the path draw-in animation (works well)\n- Modifying the task arrival pulse (already good)\n- Changing signal timing/duration\n- Adding JavaScript-based animations (keeping CSS/SVG only)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nUse SVG gradient animation for color transitions and CSS keyframes for badge pulses. Keep all timing synchronized on 4s cycles. Match the \"sharp\" aesthetic of the existing task pulse.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Signal Color Gradient Transition\n\n### Overview\n\nChange signal dots from static emerald to animated amber→emerald gradient as they travel along paths.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n- **Pause for human verification**: After completing all automated verification for a phase, pause and inform the human that the phase is ready for manual testing. Use this format:\n  ```\n  Phase [N] Complete - Ready for Manual Verification\n\n  Automated verification passed:\n  - [List automated checks that passed]\n\n  Please perform the manual verification steps listed in the plan:\n  - [List manual verification items from the plan]\n\n  Let me know when manual testing is complete so I can proceed to Phase [N+1].\n  ```\n\nIf instructed to execute multiple phases consecutively, skip the pause until the last phase. Otherwise, assume you are just doing one phase.\n\ndo not check off items in the manual testing steps until confirmed by the user.\n\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"4acf55ba-8a7c-44d8-a7e2-8e072cb0fdd4","timestamp":"2025-12-27T13:37:09.363Z"}

Replace the color-cycling glow on action badges with a technical pulse animation that matches the \"Your Tasks\" arrival effect. Add a third \"Analyze\" badge and input source departure animations.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### What Exists Now\n\n**Signal Dots** (`globals.css`, `FlowSection.tsx:71-76, 110-132`):\n- Static emerald radial gradient (`#10B981`)\n- Dots animate along paths via SMIL `<animateMotion>`\n- Fade in/out at path endpoints\n\n**Action Badges** (`globals.css:201-245`, `FlowSection.tsx:180-187`):\n- Two badges: \"Extract\" (top-left) and \"Organize\" (bottom-right)\n- 4s color-cycling glow: zinc → amber → violet → emerald\n- Different keyframes for light/dark modes\n\n**Task Arrival** (`globals.css:248-283`):\n- Pulsing emerald ring expanding outward\n- Checkmark bounce animation\n- Both on 4s cycle, trigger at 70-75%\n\n**Input Badges** (`FlowSection.tsx:136-149, 282-295`):\n- Static badges with border and icon\n- No animation currently\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n- All animations use 4s base cycle for synchronization\n- Signal duration: 3.5-5s per path (staggered)\n- Signal begin time: 1.5s + (index * 0.3s)\n- Task pulse triggers at 75% of cycle (3s mark)\n\n## Desired End State\n\n1. **Signal dots** transition from amber glow at start to emerald glow at end\n2. **Action badges** (Extract, Analyze, Organize) pulse with a sharp \"scan line\" effect synchronized with signal arrival, matching the technical blueprint aesthetic\n3. **Input badges** emit a brief amber pulse when signals depart\n4. Visual narrative: amber (pending) → processing → emerald (complete)\n\n### Verification\n\n- Visual: Signals clearly show color transition along path\n- Visual: Action badges pulse in rhythm with signals passing through\n- Visual: Input badges flash amber as signals leave\n- Technical: All animations remain GPU-optimized\n- Accessibility: Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Changing the path draw-in animation (works well)\n- Modifying the task arrival pulse (already good)\n- Changing signal timing/duration\n- Adding JavaScript-based animations (keeping CSS/SVG only)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nUse SVG gradient animation for color transitions and CSS keyframes for badge pulses. Keep all timing synchronized on 4s cycles. Match the \"sharp\" aesthetic of the existing task pulse.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Signal Color Gradient Transition\n\n### Overview\n\nChange signal dots from static emerald to animated amber→emerald gradient as they travel along paths.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. SVG Gradient Definition\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**Lines 71-76** - Replace static gradient with animated gradient:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#10B981\" />\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n\n{/* New - Animated gradient */}\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#F59E0B\">\n    <animate\n      attributeName=\"stop-color\"\n      values=\"#F59E0B;#F59E0B;#10B981;#10B981\"\n      keyTimes=\"0;0.3;0.7;1\"\n      dur=\"4s\"\n      repeatCount=\"indefinite\"\n    />\n  </stop>\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n```\n\n**Timing Rationale**:\n- 0-30%: Amber (signal departing input)\n- 30-70%: Transition (signal in AI box)\n- 70-100%: Emerald (signal approaching output)\n\n#### 2. Mobile Gradient (Same Change)\n\n**Lines 219-222** - Apply identical change to mobile gradient `flow-signal-gradient-mobile`.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [x] Lint passes: `pnpm lint` (pre-existing errors in other files, not FlowSection)\n- [x] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Signal dots start amber when leaving input badges\n- [ ] Signal dots transition to emerald as they reach AI box\n- [ ] Color transition is smooth, not jarring\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n- [ ] Mobile layout shows same color transition\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 2.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Action Badge Pulse Animation\n\n### Overview\n\nReplace color-cycling glow with a sharp \"scan line\" pulse that fires when signals pass through the AI box. More technical, blueprint-feeling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. New CSS Keyframes\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Replace lines 200-245** with:\n\n```css\n/* FlowSection Action Badge - Technical scan pulse */\n.flow-action-badge {\n  will-change: box-shadow, border-color;\n  animation: flow-action-pulse 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes flow-action-pulse {\n  0%, 60% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(228 228 231); /* zinc-200 */\n  }\n  65% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.6), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.4);\n    border-color: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.8);\n  }\n  75% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.6), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.4);\n    border-color: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.8);\n  }\n  85%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(228 228 231); /* zinc-200 */\n  }\n}\n\n.dark .flow-action-badge {\n  animation: flow-action-pulse-dark 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes flow-action-pulse-dark {\n  0%, 60% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(63 63 70); /* zinc-700 */\n  }\n  65% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.5), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.3);\n    border-color: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.7);\n  }\n  75% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.5), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.3);\n    border-color: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.7);\n  }\n  85%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(63 63 70); /* zinc-700 */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Animation Design**:\n- Sharp pulse instead of smooth glow cycling\n- Amber flash (65%) → Emerald flash (75%) → Rest\n- Matches the \"data processed\" moment\n- Inset shadow creates technical \"scan\" effect\n- Synchronized with task arrival at 75%\n\n#### 2. Staggered Animation Delays for Each Badge\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\nAdd animation delay classes to create sequence:\n\n**Desktop \"Extract\" badge (line 180)**:\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute top-3 left-3 ...\">\n\n{/* New - add inline style for delay */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute top-3 left-3 ...\" style={{ animationDelay: '0s' }}>\n```\n\n**Desktop \"Organize\" badge (line 184)**:\n```tsx\n{/* Add delay */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-3 right-3 ...\" style={{ animationDelay: '0.3s' }}>\n```\n\nSame pattern for mobile badges (lines 322, 326).\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Action badges pulse sharply (not gradual glow)\n- [ ] Pulse shows amber→emerald color sequence\n- [ ] Badges pulse in staggered sequence\n- [ ] Animation feels \"technical\" and matches task arrival\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add \"Analyze\" Badge\n\n### Overview\n\nAdd third action badge \"Analyze\" at bottom-left of AI Processing box to complete the triad: Extract → Analyze → Organize.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Desktop Layout\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**After line 187** (after the Organize badge), add:\n\n```tsx\n<div\n  className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-3 left-3 border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background px-2 py-1 text-xs font-mono text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 flex items-center gap-1\"\n  style={{ animationDelay: '0.15s' }}\n>\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:scan-search\" size={12} />\n  <span>Analyze</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Icon choice**: `lucide:scan-search` - represents data analysis/scanning. Alternatives: `lucide:search-code`, `lucide:microscope`.\n\n**Animation delay**: 0.15s (between Extract at 0s and Organize at 0.3s) for sequential pulse effect.\n\n#### 2. Mobile Layout\n\n**After line 329** (after mobile Organize badge), add:\n\n```tsx\n<div\n  className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-2 left-2 border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background px-1.5 py-0.5 text-[10px] font-mono text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 flex items-center gap-1\"\n  style={{ animationDelay: '0.15s' }}\n>\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:scan-search\" size={10} />\n  <span>Analyze</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] \"Analyze\" badge visible at bottom-left of AI box\n- [ ] Badge matches styling of Extract/Organize\n- [ ] Badge pulses in sequence: Extract → Analyze → Organize\n- [ ] Mobile layout shows badge correctly scaled\n- [ ] Badge doesn't overlap with other elements\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 4.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Input Source Pulse Animation\n\n### Overview\n\nAdd amber pulse animation to input badges (Meetings, Messages, Emails, Documents) that fires when signals depart.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. New CSS Animation\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Add after line 283** (after flow-checkmark-bounce):\n\n```css\n/* FlowSection Input Source - departure pulse */\n.flow-input-source {\n  will-change: box-shadow;\n  animation: flow-input-pulse 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Staggered delays for each input */\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.6s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.9s; }\n\n@keyframes flow-input-pulse {\n  0%, 5% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n  10% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.5);\n  }\n  20% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0);\n  }\n  25%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n}\n\n.dark .flow-input-source {\n  animation: flow-input-pulse-dark 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Staggered delays preserved in dark mode */\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.6s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.9s; }\n\n@keyframes flow-input-pulse-dark {\n  0%, 5% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n  10% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.4);\n  }\n  20% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0);\n  }\n  25%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Animation Design**:\n- Quick amber ring pulse (like signal departing)\n- Fires at start of cycle (0-20%)\n- Staggered by 0.3s to match signal stagger\n- Matches the expanding ring style of task arrival (but amber)\n\n#### 2. Apply Class to Input Badges\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**Desktop input badges (lines 140-148)**:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n{inputSources.map((source) => (\n  <div\n    key={source.label}\n    className=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-2 py-2.5 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background\"\n  >\n\n{/* New - add flow-input-source class */}\n{inputSources.map((source) => (\n  <div\n    key={source.label}\n    className=\"flow-input-source flex items-center justify-center gap-2 py-2.5 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background\"\n  >\n```\n\n**Mobile input badges (lines 286-294)** - Same change, add `flow-input-source` class.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Input badges pulse amber at start of animation cycle\n- [ ] Pulses are staggered (each badge pulses at different time)\n- [ ] Ring expands outward (matches task arrival style)\n- [ ] Animation syncs with signal departure timing\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, verify the complete animation sequence flows correctly from inputs → AI box → output.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\nN/A - Visual animations, no logic to unit test.\n\n### Integration Tests\nN/A - CSS/SVG animations.\n\n### Manual Testing Steps\n\n1. **Full flow test**: Watch complete animation cycle (4s)\n   - Input badges pulse amber (0-0.5s staggered)\n   - Signals travel from inputs, transitioning amber→emerald\n   - Action badges pulse amber→emerald as signals pass (2.5-3.5s)\n   - Task output pulses emerald, checkmark bounces (3s)\n\n2. **Dark mode test**: Toggle theme, verify all animations work\n\n3. **Mobile test**: Resize to mobile, verify layout and timing\n\n4. **Reduced motion test**: Enable `prefers-reduced-motion`, verify animations are disabled/reduced\n\n5. **Performance test**: Check for jank using Chrome DevTools Performance tab\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- All animations use GPU-optimized properties (`transform`, `box-shadow`, `opacity`)\n- `will-change` hints added for box-shadow animations\n- No JavaScript animation overhead\n- Animations are CSS/SVG declarative (browser-optimized)\n\n## Accessibility\n\n- Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query\n- Colors are not the only indicator (shape, position, labels all provide context)\n- Animation timing is slow enough to not cause discomfort (4s cycle)\n\n## References\n\n- Research: `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-flow-section-component.md`\n- Design system: `docs/design-system.md` (Accent colors: Amber #F59E0B, Emerald #10B981)\n- Component: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n- Styles: `src/app/globals.css:200-283`\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":222,"oldLines":9,"newStart":222,"newLines":9,"lines":[" ### Success Criteria:"," "," #### Automated Verification:","-- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`","-- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`","-- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`","+- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`","+- [x] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`","+- [x] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`"," "," #### Manual Verification:"," - [ ] Action badges pulse sharply (not gradual glow)"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Replace the color-cycling glow on action badges with a technical pulse animation that matches the \"Your Tasks\" arrival effect. Add a third \"Analyze\" badge and input source departure animations.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### What Exists Now\n\n**Signal Dots** (`globals.css`, `FlowSection.tsx:71-76, 110-132`):\n- Static emerald radial gradient (`#10B981`)\n- Dots animate along paths via SMIL `<animateMotion>`\n- Fade in/out at path endpoints\n\n**Action Badges** (`globals.css:201-245`, `FlowSection.tsx:180-187`):\n- Two badges: \"Extract\" (top-left) and \"Organize\" (bottom-right)\n- 4s color-cycling glow: zinc → amber → violet → emerald\n- Different keyframes for light/dark modes\n\n**Task Arrival** (`globals.css:248-283`):\n- Pulsing emerald ring expanding outward\n- Checkmark bounce animation\n- Both on 4s cycle, trigger at 70-75%\n\n**Input Badges** (`FlowSection.tsx:136-149, 282-295`):\n- Static badges with border and icon\n- No animation currently\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n- All animations use 4s base cycle for synchronization\n- Signal duration: 3.5-5s per path (staggered)\n- Signal begin time: 1.5s + (index * 0.3s)\n- Task pulse triggers at 75% of cycle (3s mark)\n\n## Desired End State\n\n1. **Signal dots** transition from amber glow at start to emerald glow at end\n2. **Action badges** (Extract, Analyze, Organize) pulse with a sharp \"scan line\" effect synchronized with signal arrival, matching the technical blueprint aesthetic\n3. **Input badges** emit a brief amber pulse when signals depart\n4. Visual narrative: amber (pending) → processing → emerald (complete)\n\n### Verification\n\n- Visual: Signals clearly show color transition along path\n- Visual: Action badges pulse in rhythm with signals passing through\n- Visual: Input badges flash amber as signals leave\n- Technical: All animations remain GPU-optimized\n- Accessibility: Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Changing the path draw-in animation (works well)\n- Modifying the task arrival pulse (already good)\n- Changing signal timing/duration\n- Adding JavaScript-based animations (keeping CSS/SVG only)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nUse SVG gradient animation for color transitions and CSS keyframes for badge pulses. Keep all timing synchronized on 4s cycles. Match the \"sharp\" aesthetic of the existing task pulse.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Signal Color Gradient Transition\n\n### Overview\n\nChange signal dots from static emerald to animated amber→emerald gradient as they travel along paths.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. SVG Gradient Definition\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**Lines 71-76** - Replace static gradient with animated gradient:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#10B981\" />\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n\n{/* New - Animated gradient */}\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#F59E0B\">\n    <animate\n      attributeName=\"stop-color\"\n      values=\"#F59E0B;#F59E0B;#10B981;#10B981\"\n      keyTimes=\"0;0.3;0.7;1\"\n      dur=\"4s\"\n      repeatCount=\"indefinite\"\n    />\n  </stop>\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n```\n\n**Timing Rationale**:\n- 0-30%: Amber (signal departing input)\n- 30-70%: Transition (signal in AI box)\n- 70-100%: Emerald (signal approaching output)\n\n#### 2. Mobile Gradient (Same Change)\n\n**Lines 219-222** - Apply identical change to mobile gradient `flow-signal-gradient-mobile`.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [x] Lint passes: `pnpm lint` (pre-existing errors in other files, not FlowSection)\n- [x] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Signal dots start amber when leaving input badges\n- [ ] Signal dots transition to emerald as they reach AI box\n- [ ] Color transition is smooth, not jarring\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n- [ ] Mobile layout shows same color transition\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 2.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Action Badge Pulse Animation\n\n### Overview\n\nReplace color-cycling glow with a sharp \"scan line\" pulse that fires when signals pass through the AI box. More technical, blueprint-feeling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. New CSS Keyframes\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Replace lines 200-245** with:\n\n```css\n/* FlowSection Action Badge - Technical scan pulse */\n.flow-action-badge {\n  will-change: box-shadow, border-color;\n  animation: flow-action-pulse 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes flow-action-pulse {\n  0%, 60% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(228 228 231); /* zinc-200 */\n  }\n  65% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.6), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.4);\n    border-color: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.8);\n  }\n  75% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.6), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.4);\n    border-color: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.8);\n  }\n  85%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(228 228 231); /* zinc-200 */\n  }\n}\n\n.dark .flow-action-badge {\n  animation: flow-action-pulse-dark 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes flow-action-pulse-dark {\n  0%, 60% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(63 63 70); /* zinc-700 */\n  }\n  65% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.5), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.3);\n    border-color: rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.7);\n  }\n  75% {\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.5), 0 0 8px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.3);\n    border-color: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.7);\n  }\n  85%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n    border-color: rgb(63 63 70); /* zinc-700 */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Animation Design**:\n- Sharp pulse instead of smooth glow cycling\n- Amber flash (65%) → Emerald flash (75%) → Rest\n- Matches the \"data processed\" moment\n- Inset shadow creates technical \"scan\" effect\n- Synchronized with task arrival at 75%\n\n#### 2. Staggered Animation Delays for Each Badge\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\nAdd animation delay classes to create sequence:\n\n**Desktop \"Extract\" badge (line 180)**:\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute top-3 left-3 ...\">\n\n{/* New - add inline style for delay */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute top-3 left-3 ...\" style={{ animationDelay: '0s' }}>\n```\n\n**Desktop \"Organize\" badge (line 184)**:\n```tsx\n{/* Add delay */}\n<div className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-3 right-3 ...\" style={{ animationDelay: '0.3s' }}>\n```\n\nSame pattern for mobile badges (lines 322, 326).\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [x] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [x] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Action badges pulse sharply (not gradual glow)\n- [ ] Pulse shows amber→emerald color sequence\n- [ ] Badges pulse in staggered sequence\n- [ ] Animation feels \"technical\" and matches task arrival\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add \"Analyze\" Badge\n\n### Overview\n\nAdd third action badge \"Analyze\" at bottom-left of AI Processing box to complete the triad: Extract → Analyze → Organize.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Desktop Layout\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**After line 187** (after the Organize badge), add:\n\n```tsx\n<div\n  className=\"flow-action-badge absolute bottom-3 left-3 border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background px-2 py-1 text-xs font-mono text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 flex items-center gap-1\"\n  style={{ animationDelay: '0.15s' }}\n>\n  <Icon icon=\"lucide:scan-search\" size={12} />\n  <span>Analyze</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Icon choice**: `lucide:scan-search` - represents data analysis/scanning. Alternatives: `lucide:search-code`, `lucide:microscope`.\n\n**Animation delay**: 0.15s (between Extract at 0s and Organize at 0.3s) for sequential pulse effect.\n\n#### 2.

New CSS Animation\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Add after line 283** (after flow-checkmark-bounce):\n\n```css\n/* FlowSection Input Source - departure pulse */\n.flow-input-source {\n  will-change: box-shadow;\n  animation: flow-input-pulse 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Staggered delays for each input */\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.6s; }\n.flow-input-source:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.9s; }\n\n@keyframes flow-input-pulse {\n  0%, 5% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n  10% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.5);\n  }\n  20% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0);\n  }\n  25%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n}\n\n.dark .flow-input-source {\n  animation: flow-input-pulse-dark 4s ease-out infinite;\n}\n\n/* Staggered delays preserved in dark mode */\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.6s; }\n.dark .flow-input-source:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.9s; }\n\n@keyframes flow-input-pulse-dark {\n  0%, 5% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n  10% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.4);\n  }\n  20% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(245, 158, 11, 0);\n  }\n  25%, 100% {\n    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 transparent;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Animation Design**:\n- Quick amber ring pulse (like signal departing)\n- Fires at start of cycle (0-20%)\n- Staggered by 0.3s to match signal stagger\n- Matches the expanding ring style of task arrival (but amber)\n\n#### 2. Apply Class to Input Badges\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**Desktop input badges (lines 140-148)**:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n{inputSources.map((source) => (\n  <div\n    key={source.label}\n    className=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-2 py-2.5 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background\"\n  >\n\n{/* New - add flow-input-source class */}\n{inputSources.map((source) => (\n  <div\n    key={source.label}\n    className=\"flow-input-source flex items-center justify-center gap-2 py-2.5 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-background\"\n  >\n```\n\n**Mobile input badges (lines 286-294)** - Same change, add `flow-input-source` class.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`\n- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Input badges pulse amber at start of animation cycle\n- [ ] Pulses are staggered (each badge pulses at different time)\n- [ ] Ring expands outward (matches task arrival style)\n- [ ] Animation syncs with signal departure timing\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, verify the complete animation sequence flows correctly from inputs → AI box → output.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\nN/A - Visual animations, no logic to unit test.\n\n### Integration Tests\nN/A - CSS/SVG animations.\n\n### Manual Testing Steps\n\n1. **Full flow test**: Watch complete animation cycle (4s)\n   - Input badges pulse amber (0-0.5s staggered)\n   - Signals travel from inputs, transitioning amber→emerald\n   - Action badges pulse amber→emerald as signals pass (2.5-3.5s)\n   - Task output pulses emerald, checkmark bounces (3s)\n\n2. **Dark mode test**: Toggle theme, verify all animations work\n\n3. **Mobile test**: Resize to mobile, verify layout and timing\n\n4. **Reduced motion test**: Enable `prefers-reduced-motion`, verify animations are disabled/reduced\n\n5. **Performance test**: Check for jank using Chrome DevTools Performance tab\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- All animations use GPU-optimized properties (`transform`, `box-shadow`, `opacity`)\n- `will-change` hints added for box-shadow animations\n- No JavaScript animation overhead\n- Animations are CSS/SVG declarative (browser-optimized)\n\n## Accessibility\n\n- Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query\n- Colors are not the only indicator (shape, position, labels all provide context)\n- Animation timing is slow enough to not cause discomfort (4s cycle)\n\n## References\n\n- Research: `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-27-flow-section-component.md`\n- Design system: `docs/design-system.md` (Accent colors: Amber #F59E0B, Emerald #10B981)\n- Component: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n- Styles: `src/app/globals.css:200-283`\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":282,"oldLines":9,"newStart":282,"newLines":9,"lines":[" ### Success Criteria:"," "," #### Automated Verification:","-- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`","-- [ ] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`","-- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`","+- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`","+- [x] Lint passes: `pnpm lint`","+- [x] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`"," "," #### Manual Verification:"," - [ ] \"Analyze\" badge visible at bottom-left of AI box"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Replace the color-cycling glow on action badges with a technical pulse animation that matches the \"Your Tasks\" arrival effect. Add a third \"Analyze\" badge and input source departure animations.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### What Exists Now\n\n**Signal Dots** (`globals.css`, `FlowSection.tsx:71-76, 110-132`):\n- Static emerald radial gradient (`#10B981`)\n- Dots animate along paths via SMIL `<animateMotion>`\n- Fade in/out at path endpoints\n\n**Action Badges** (`globals.css:201-245`, `FlowSection.tsx:180-187`):\n- Two badges: \"Extract\" (top-left) and \"Organize\" (bottom-right)\n- 4s color-cycling glow: zinc → amber → violet → emerald\n- Different keyframes for light/dark modes\n\n**Task Arrival** (`globals.css:248-283`):\n- Pulsing emerald ring expanding outward\n- Checkmark bounce animation\n- Both on 4s cycle, trigger at 70-75%\n\n**Input Badges** (`FlowSection.tsx:136-149, 282-295`):\n- Static badges with border and icon\n- No animation currently\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n- All animations use 4s base cycle for synchronization\n- Signal duration: 3.5-5s per path (staggered)\n- Signal begin time: 1.5s + (index * 0.3s)\n- Task pulse triggers at 75% of cycle (3s mark)\n\n## Desired End State\n\n1. **Signal dots** transition from amber glow at start to emerald glow at end\n2. **Action badges** (Extract, Analyze, Organize) pulse with a sharp \"scan line\" effect synchronized with signal arrival, matching the technical blueprint aesthetic\n3. **Input badges** emit a brief amber pulse when signals depart\n4. Visual narrative: amber (pending) → processing → emerald (complete)\n\n### Verification\n\n- Visual: Signals clearly show color transition along path\n- Visual: Action badges pulse in rhythm with signals passing through\n- Visual: Input badges flash amber as signals leave\n- Technical: All animations remain GPU-optimized\n- Accessibility: Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Changing the path draw-in animation (works well)\n- Modifying the task arrival pulse (already good)\n- Changing signal timing/duration\n- Adding JavaScript-based animations (keeping CSS/SVG only)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nUse SVG gradient animation for color transitions and CSS keyframes for badge pulses. Keep all timing synchronized on 4s cycles. Match the \"sharp\" aesthetic of the existing task pulse.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Signal Color Gradient Transition\n\n### Overview\n\nChange signal dots from static emerald to animated amber→emerald gradient as they travel along paths.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. SVG Gradient Definition\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx`\n\n**Lines 71-76** - Replace static gradient with animated gradient:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Current */}\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#10B981\" />\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n\n{/* New - Animated gradient */}\n<radialGradient id=\"flow-signal-gradient\" fx=\"0.5\" fy=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stopColor=\"#F59E0B\">\n    <animate\n      attributeName=\"stop-color\"\n      values=\"#F59E0B;#F59E0B;#10B981;#10B981\"\n      keyTimes=\"0;0.3;0.7;1\"\n      dur=\"4s\"\n      repeatCount=\"indefinite\"\n    />\n  </stop>\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stopColor=\"transparent\" />\n</radialGradient>\n```\n\n**Timing Rationale**:\n- 0-30%: Amber (signal departing input)\n- 30-70%: Transition (signal in AI box)\n- 70-100%: Emerald (signal approaching output)\n\n#### 2. Mobile Gradient (Same Change)\n\n**Lines 219-222** - Apply identical change to mobile gradient `flow-signal-gradient-mobile`.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`\n- [x] Lint passes: `pnpm lint` (pre-existing errors in other files, not FlowSection)\n- [x] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Signal dots start amber when leaving input badges\n- [ ] Signal dots transition to emerald as they reach AI box\n- [ ] Color transition is smooth, not jarring\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n- [ ] Mobile layout shows same color transition\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation before proceeding to Phase 2.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Action Badge Pulse Animation\n\n### Overview\n\nReplace color-cycling glow with a sharp \"scan line\" pulse that fires when signals pass through the AI box. More technical, blueprint-feeling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

All signal dot colors change at the same time - they should change on individual timing\n2. The color changes too fast and at the end - the color should change while the signal is behind/inside the AI processing box\n\nLooking at the current implementation, the SVG gradient animation is shared by all signal dots, so they all transition together. Each signal dot uses the same gradient `url(#flow-signal-gradient)`, which has a single animated color transition.\n\nTo fix this, I need to:\n1. Create individual gradients for each signal path with different timing\n2. Adjust the timing so the color transition happens when the signal is in the middle of the path (inside the AI box), not at the start/end\n\nLet me think about this:\n- The signals have different durations: 3.5s, 4s, 4.5s, 5s (for indices 0-3)\n- The signals have different start times: 1.5s, 1.8s, 2.1s, 2.4s\n- Currently the gradient animates on a fixed 4s cycle independent of signal position\n\nThe issue is that the gradient animation is time-based, not position-based. SMIL doesn't easily allow position-based color changes.\n\nTo fix this properly, I should:\n1. Create 4 separate gradients, one for each signal\n2. Give each gradient a different animation timing that roughly corresponds to when that signal would be in the AI box\n\nLooking at the path structure:\n- Signal starts at input badge (~y=30)\n- AI box starts at ~22% of container (around y=110 in viewBox 0 0 400 500)\n- AI box ends at ~62% (22% + 40% height)\n- Signals end at bottom of viewBox\n\nSo in the path journey:\n- First ~20% is going down from input and horizontal\n- ~20-60% is passing through the AI box area\n\n\n- ~60-100% is exiting toward the bottom\n\nI'll create unique color transitions for each signal that align with their specific path timing. By developing individual gradients synchronized to each signal's movement, I can ensure the color changes precisely when the signal passes through the AI processing area. This approach addresses the timing and positioning issues while maintaining the visual flow of the signals.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":119244,"cache_read_input_tokens":13502,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":119244,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWXJKfk8nDHw8bdtvQGve","type":"assistant","uuid":"df0101ed-9871-49f0-b5e2-28495255b452","timestamp":"2025-12-27T13:50:36.978Z"}
