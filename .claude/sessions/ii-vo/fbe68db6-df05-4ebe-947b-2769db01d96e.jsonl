Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n\n2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n\n   **For codebase research:**\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)\n   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to find examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.\n\n   **For thoughts directory:**\n   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic\n   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)\n\n   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n\n   **For Linear tickets (if relevant):**\n   - Use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details of a specific ticket\n   - Use the **linear-searcher** agent to find related tickets or historical context\n\n   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings to document how they work\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n   - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving\n\n4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/allison/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n\n5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**\n   - Run the `hack/spec_metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata\n   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n     - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n       - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n       - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic\n     - Examples:\n       - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n       - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`\n\n6. **Generate research document:**\n   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4\n   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n     ```markdown\n     ---\n     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]\n     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     git_commit: [Current commit hash]\n     branch: [Current branch name]\n     repository: [Repository name]\n     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n     status: complete\n     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]\n     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]\n     ---\n\n     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]\n     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]\n     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]\n     **Repository**: [Repository name]\n\n     ## Research Question\n     [Original user query]\n\n     ## Summary\n     [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]\n\n     ## Detailed Findings\n\n     ### [Component/Area 1]\n     - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))\n     - How it connects to other components\n     - Current implementation details (without evaluation)\n\n     ### [Component/Area 2]\n     ...\n\n     ## Code References\n     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there\n     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block\n\n     ## Architecture Documentation\n     [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]\n\n     ## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n     [Relevant insights from thoughts/ directory with references]\n     - `thoughts/shared/something.md` - Historical decision about X\n     - `thoughts/local/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y\n     Note: Paths exclude \"searchable/\" even if found there\n\n     ## Related Research\n     [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]\n\n     ## Open Questions\n     [Any areas that need further investigation]\n     ```\n\n7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**\n   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`\n   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:\n     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`\n     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`\n   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document\n\n8. **Sync and present findings:**\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the thoughts directory\n   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user\n   - Include key file references for easy navigation\n   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification\n\n9. **Handle follow-up questions:**\n   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document\n   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update\n   - Add `last_updated_note: \"Added follow-up research for [brief description]\"` to frontmatter\n   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`\n   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation\n   - Continue updating the document and syncing\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage\n- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents\n- The thoughts/ directory provides historical context to supplement live findings\n- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference\n- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context\n- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations\n- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact\n- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)\n- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references\n- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading\n- Have sub-agents document examples and usage patterns as they exist\n- Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory\n- **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators\n- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE\n- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase\n- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks\n- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly\n  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)\n  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)\n  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)\n  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values\n- **Path handling**: The thoughts/searchable/ directory contains hard links for searching\n  - Always document paths by removing ONLY \"searchable/\" - preserve all other subdirectories\n  - Examples of correct transformations:\n    - `thoughts/searchable/allison/old_stuff/notes.md` → `thoughts/allison/old_stuff/notes.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/shared/prs/123.md` → `thoughts/shared/prs/123.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/global/shared/templates.md` → `thoughts/global/shared/templates.md`\n  - NEVER change allison/ to shared/ or vice versa - preserve the exact directory structure\n  - This ensures paths are correct for editing and navigation\n- **Frontmatter consistency**:\n  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents\n  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents\n  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research\n  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)\n  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"2873b407-143b-4776-b356-27e9968a8612","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:24:14.986Z"}

Isolate complex business logic in `features/`.\n- **Colocation**: Keep related files (tests, styles, components) adjacent to their usage.\n- **Configuration**: `proxy.ts` replaces Middleware for network boundaries; `instrumentation.ts` handles server startup.\n\n## Recommended Folder Structure\n\n```markdown\n.\n├── next.config.ts\n├── package.json\n├── src/\n│   ├── app/                       # Routing Layer Only\n│   │   ├── (marketing)/           # Route Group: Logical separation, no URL impact\n│   │   │   ├── blog/\n│   │   │   │   ├── [slug]/        # Dynamic Route: Matches /blog/post-1\n│   │   │   │   │   └── page.tsx\n│   │   │   │   └── page.tsx\n│   │   │   └── layout.tsx\n│   │   ├── (dashboard)/           # Route Group: Authenticated area\n│   │   │   ├── @modal/            # Parallel Route: Independent rendering slot\n│   │   │   │   ├── (.)settings/   # Intercepting Route: Renders /settings as modal\n│   │   │   │   │   └── page.tsx\n│   │   │   │   └── default.tsx    # Fallback for empty slot\n│   │   │   └── settings/          # Standalone Route: Full page refresh target\n│   │   │       └── page.tsx\n│   │   ├── api/                   # Route Handlers (API endpoints)\n│   │   ├── global-error.tsx       # Global error handling\n│   │   └── layout.tsx             # Root Layout (Server Component)\n│   ├── components/                # Shared UI primitives (Buttons, Inputs)\n│   │   └── ui/\n│   ├── features/                  # Domain-Driven Design (Business Logic)\n│   │   ├── auth/                  # Feature: Authentication\n│   │   │   ├── actions.ts         # Server Actions (form handling)\n│   │   │   └── components/        # Auth-specific UI\n│   │   └── billing/               # Feature: Billing\n│   ├── lib/                       # Singletons & Configs (DB, Stripe)\n│   ├── providers/                 # Client Contexts (Theme, QueryClient)\n│   │   └── root-provider.tsx      # Master wrapper for layout.tsx\n│   ├── instrumentation.ts         # Server Startup (OpenTelemetry, Sentry)\n│   └── proxy.ts                   # Network Boundary (Middleware replacement)\n```\n\n## Key Concepts Explained\n\n| Concept | Pattern | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Route Groups** | `(folder)` | Groups routes (e.g., admin vs. marketing) without affecting the URL path. Enables different layouts for different sections. |\n| **Dynamic Routes** | `[slug]` | Matches dynamic segments (e.g., `/blog/1`). Use `[...slug]` for catch-all segments. |\n| **Parallel Routes** | `@slot` | Renders multiple pages simultaneously in the same layout. Useful for complex dashboards or modals. |\n| **Intercepting** | `(.)route` | Loads a route (like `/login`) within the current layout (e.g., as a modal) while maintaining a shareable URL. |\n| **Private Folders** | `_folder` | Excludes a folder and its children from routing entirely. Good for internal utilities inside `app/` . |\n| **Instrumentation** | `instrumentation.ts` | Runs once at server startup. Use for initializing observability, error logging, or database connections. |\n\ndo not implement anything yet"},"uuid":"29388250-651e-4afe-9b16-5e24c0e67ac6","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:24:53.997Z","thinkingMetadata":{"level":"high","disabled":false,"triggers":[]},"todos":[]}

You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n\n    - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n    - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n    - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n\n    - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n    - Research documents\n    - Related implementation plans\n    - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n    - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n    - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n    - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**: Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n    - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n    - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n    - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n    - If a Linear ticket is mentioned, use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details\n\n    These agents will:\n\n    - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n    - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)\n    - Trace data flow and key functions\n    - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n\n    - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n    - Read them FULLY into the main context\n    - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n\n    - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n    - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n    - Note assumptions that need verification\n    - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n\n    ```\n    Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n    I've found that:\n    - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n    - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n    - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n    Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n    - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n    - [Business logic clarification]\n    - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n    ```\n\n    Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n\n    - DO NOT just accept the correction\n    - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n    - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n    - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n\n    - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n    - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n    **For deeper investigation:**\n\n    - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n    - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n    - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n    **For historical context:**\n\n    - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n    - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n    **For related tickets:**\n\n    - **linear-searcher** - To find similar issues or past implementations\n\n    Each agent knows how to:\n\n    - Find the right files and code patterns\n    - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n    - Look for integration points and dependencies\n    - Return specific file:line references\n    - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n\n    ```\n    Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n    **Current State:**\n    - [Key discovery about existing code]\n    - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n    **Design Options:**\n    1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n    2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n    **Open Questions:**\n    - [Technical uncertainty]\n    - [Design decision needed]\n\n    Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n\n    ```\n    Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n    ## Overview\n    [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n    ## Implementation Phases:\n    1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n    2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n    3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n    Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n    ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n    - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n        - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n        - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n        - description is a brief kebab-case description\n    - Examples:\n        - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n        - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-improve-error-handling.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n````markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n\n-   [Important finding with file:line reference]\n-   [Pattern to follow]\n-   [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext` **Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n-   [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n-   [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n-   [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n-   [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n-   [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n-   [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n-   [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n\n-   [What to test]\n-   [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n\n-   [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n-   Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n-   Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n-   Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n````\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n\n    - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the newly created plan\n    - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n\n    ```\n    I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n    `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n\n    Please review it and let me know:\n    - Are the phases properly scoped?\n    - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n    - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n    - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n    ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n\n    - Add missing phases\n    - Adjust technical approach\n    - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n    - Add/remove scope items\n    - After making changes, run `humanlayer thoughts sync` again\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n\n    - Question vague requirements\n    - Identify potential issues early\n    - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n    - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n\n    - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n    - Get buy-in at each major step\n    - Allow course corrections\n    - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n\n    - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n    - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n    - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n    - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n    - automated steps should use `make` whenever possible - for example `make -C humanlayer-wui check` instead of `cd humanlayer-wui && bun run fmt`\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n\n    - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n    - Consider migration and rollback\n    - Think about edge cases\n    - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n\n    - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n    - Update todos as you complete research\n    - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n    - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n    - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n    - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n    - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n    - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n\n    - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n    - Specific files that should exist\n    - Code compilation/type checking\n    - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n    - UI/UX functionality\n    - Performance under real conditions\n    - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n    - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n-   [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n-   [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n-   [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n\n-   [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n-   [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n-   [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n-   [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n\n-   Start with schema/migration\n-   Add store methods\n-   Update business logic\n-   Expose via API\n-   Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n\n-   Research existing patterns first\n-   Start with data model\n-   Build backend logic\n-   Add API endpoints\n-   Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n\n-   Document current behavior\n-   Plan incremental changes\n-   Maintain backwards compatibility\n-   Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n    - Exactly what to search for\n    - Which directories to focus on\n    - What information to extract\n    - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n    - If the ticket mentions \"WUI\", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory\n    - If it mentions \"daemon\", specify `hld/` directory\n    - Never use generic terms like \"UI\" when you mean \"WUI\"\n    - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n    - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n    - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n    - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /create_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon.

No API route handlers\n\n**Routing patterns NOT used:**\n| Pattern | Example | Status |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n| Route Groups | `(marketing)/` | Not used |\n| Dynamic Routes | `[slug]/` | Not used |\n| Parallel Routes | `@modal/` | Not used |\n| Intercepting Routes | `(.)settings/` | Not used |\n| Private Folders | `_folder/` | Not used |\n\n### Current `src/components/` Structure\n\n**Organization:**\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── bento/                    # Domain-specific (bento cards)\n│   ├── DataVaultCard.tsx\n│   └── IntegrationsCard.tsx\n├── ui/                       # UI primitives\n│   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   ├── Button.tsx\n│   ├── Container.tsx\n│   ├── InfiniteSlider.tsx\n│   └── PlusCornerCard.tsx\n├── Header.tsx                # Landing page sections\n├── Hero.tsx\n├── FlowSection.tsx\n├── BentoFeatures.tsx\n├── TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\n├── SecondaryCTA.tsx\n├── FAQ.tsx\n├── Footer.tsx\n├── Icon.tsx                  # Utility components\n├── Logo.tsx\n├── ThemeProvider.tsx         # Should be in providers/\n└── ThemeToggle.tsx\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- `ThemeProvider.tsx` lives in `components/` rather than a dedicated `providers/` directory\n- Landing page sections are at root level rather than grouped (e.g., in `landing/` or `sections/`)\n- `ui/` contains both ShadCN components and custom primitives\n\n### Current `src/lib/` Structure\n\n**Files:**\n- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Contains only `cn()` utility\n\n**Recommended additions (when needed):**\n- Database clients\n- External service configs (Stripe, etc.)\n- Singleton instances\n\n### Missing Recommended Directories\n\n| Directory | Purpose | Current State |\n|-----------|---------|---------------|\n| `src/features/` | Domain-driven business logic | Does not exist |\n| `src/providers/` | Client contexts | ThemeProvider in components/ |\n| `instrumentation.ts` | Server startup hooks | Does not exist |\n| `proxy.ts` | Network boundary (middleware replacement) | Does not exist |\n| `middleware.ts` | Traditional Next.js middleware | Does not exist |\n\n## Code References\n\n- `src/app/layout.tsx:32-46` - Root layout implementation\n- `src/app/page.tsx:10-25` - Landing page component\n- `src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Theme context (should move to providers/)\n- `src/lib/utils.ts` - cn() utility function\n\n## Architecture Documentation\n\n### Current State\n\nThe project is structured as a **minimal marketing site** with:\n- Single page architecture (only `/` route exists)\n- Flat component hierarchy\n- No API routes or server actions\n- No authentication or protected routes\n- Theme system via ThemeProvider\n\n### When Advanced Patterns Become Relevant\n\n| Pattern | When to Use | Current Need |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|\n| Route Groups `(folder)` | Multiple distinct layouts (marketing vs app) | Not yet needed |\n| Dynamic Routes `[slug]` | Blog posts, user profiles | Not yet needed |\n| Parallel Routes `@slot` | Dashboard with modals, sidebars | Not yet needed |\n| Intercepting `(.)route` | Modal overlays with direct URLs | Not yet needed |\n| `features/` directory | Business logic separation | Not yet needed |\n| `providers/` directory | Multiple contexts | Could organize ThemeProvider here |\n| `instrumentation.ts` | OpenTelemetry, Sentry init | When observability added |\n| `proxy.ts` | Auth checks, redirects | When auth added |\n\n## Alignment Summary\n\n### Currently Aligned ✓\n\n1. **`src/` directory** - Application code separated from config files\n2. **`app/` for routing** - Only routing/layout concerns in app/\n3. **`components/ui/`** - Shared UI primitives in dedicated folder\n4. **`lib/`** - Utilities and configs isolated\n\n### Gaps to Address When Scaling\n\n1. **`src/providers/`** - Create and move ThemeProvider there\n2. **`src/features/`** - Create when business logic grows\n3. **Route Groups** - Add `(marketing)/` when dashboard routes are added\n4. **`instrumentation.ts`** - Add when observability is needed\n5. **Error handling** - Add `global-error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx` when needed\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should `ThemeProvider.tsx` move to `src/providers/` now for consistency?\n2. Should landing page section components be grouped (e.g., `components/sections/`)?\n3. When is the right time to introduce the `features/` directory pattern?\n","numLines":204,"startLine":1,"totalLines":204}}}

I now have comprehensive information about how to configure Claude Code to enforce folder structure conventions. Let me provide you with a complete answer.\n\n## How to Configure Claude Code for Folder Structure Conventions\n\nThere are **three primary mechanisms** you can use to enforce folder structure conventions in Claude Code, and you're already using one of them effectively:\n\n### 1. CLAUDE.md (Project Instructions) - Your Primary Tool\n\nYou already have this set up at `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/CLAUDE.md`. This is the **most important configuration file** for establishing architectural conventions.\n\n**What you're doing right**:\n- Documenting project structure clearly\n- Specifying ShadCN UI installation patterns\n- Explaining component organization (ui/, bento/, components/)\n- Defining code style conventions\n\n**To maximize CLAUDE.md for folder structure enforcement**:\n\n```markdown\n## File Placement Conventions\n\n### Required Folder Structure\n- **src/components/** → All React components\n  - **ui/** → ShadCN primitives and their wrappers\n  - **bento/** → Bento grid card variants\n  - **sections/** → Page sections (Hero, FAQ, etc.)\n- **src/lib/** → Utilities and helpers\n- **src/app/** → Next.js app router files\n- **src/providers/** → Context providers, layout providers\n- **src/hooks/** → Custom React hooks\n- **src/types/** → TypeScript type definitions\n- **.claude/rules/** → Project-specific rules files\n- **docs/** → Project documentation\n\n### When Creating New Files\n- UI primitives → `src/components/ui/ComponentName.tsx`\n- ShadCN wrappers → `src/components/ComponentName.tsx` (wraps from ui/)\n- Page sections → `src/components/[SectionName].tsx`\n- Utilities → `src/lib/[utilityName].ts`\n- Hooks → `src/hooks/use[HookName].ts`\n- Types → `src/types/[domain].ts`\n\n### Component Wrapper Pattern for ShadCN\nAlways follow this pattern:\n1. Install ShadCN: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n2. Component installs to `src/components/ui/<component>`\n3. Create wrapper at `src/components/<Component>.tsx`\n4. Wrapper applies brand-specific styling\n```\n\n### 2. `.claude/rules/` (Modular Path-Specific Rules)\n\nThis is the **newest and most powerful mechanism** for enforcing conventions. Create modular rule files that apply to specific file types:\n\nCreate `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/.claude/rules/` directory with files like:\n\n**`.claude/rules/components.md`** - For component file placement:\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/components/**/*.{tsx,ts}\n---\n\n# Component Development Rules\n\n## File Placement\n- UI primitives (buttons, cards, etc.) → `src/components/ui/`\n- ShadCN wrappers → `src/components/` (root level)\n- Bento grid cards → `src/components/bento/`\n- Page sections → `src/components/` (root level)\n\n## ShadCN Component Pattern\n- Never modify files in `src/components/ui/`\n- Always create wrappers in `src/components/ComponentName.tsx`\n- Wrappers must import ShadCN component and apply brand styling\n\nExample:\n```tsx\nimport { Button as ShadcnButton } from \"@/components/ui/button\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\nexport function Button({ className, ...props }) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnButton\n      className={cn(\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\", className)}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Styling Rules\n- Always use `rounded-none` (no border radius)\n- Always include dark mode variants: `dark:`\n- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n- Never use px/rem directly—use Tailwind values\n```\n\n**`.claude/rules/file-organization.md`** - For broader structure:\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/**/*.{tsx,ts,js}\n---\n\n# File Organization Rules\n\n## Naming Conventions\n- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `DataVaultCard.tsx`)\n- Utils: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)\n- Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useAnimation.ts`)\n- Types: PascalCase (e.g., `CardProps.ts`)\n\n## Directory Structure\n- `src/app/` → Next.js App Router structure only\n- `src/lib/` → TypeScript utilities, type helpers\n- `src/components/` → React components\n  - No subdirectories unless specifically `ui/` or `bento/`\n- `src/hooks/` → Custom React hooks\n- `src/types/` → Type definitions\n\n## When in Doubt\n- Ask for clarification rather than creating new directory structures\n- Check CLAUDE.md for existing patterns\n```\n\n### 3. `.claude/settings.json` (Permissions & Restrictions)\n\nYou already have this at `.claude/settings.json`. Use the **permissions system** to prevent file creation in wrong locations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"deny\": [\n      \"Write(src/components/ui/**)\",\n      \"Edit(src/components/ui/**)\",\n      \"Write(./src/providers/**)\",\n      \"Write(./src/hooks/**)\"\n    ],\n    \"allow\": [\n      \"Write(src/components/**)\",\n      \"Write(src/lib/**)\",\n      \"Write(src/app/**)\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**What this does**: Prevents accidental modifications to ShadCN files and establishes allowed write zones.\n\n### 4. Hooks (Automated Enforcement)\n\nYou can create hooks that automatically validate file placement before Claude makes edits:\n\n**`.claude/hooks/validate-file-placement.sh`** - Add to your `settings.json`:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Validate that files are being created in the right locations\n\ninput=$(cat)\nfile_path=$(echo \"$input\" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty')\n\nif [ -z \"$file_path\" ]; then\n  exit 0\nfi\n\n# Check for violations\nif [[ \"$file_path\" =~ ^src/components/ui/.*\\.tsx$ ]]; then\n  echo \"Error: ShadCN UI components should not be modified. Create a wrapper in src/components/ instead.\"\n  exit 2\nfi\n\nif [[ \"$file_path\" =~ ^src/lib/.*\\.tsx$ ]]; then\n  echo \"Error: Utilities should be .ts files, not .tsx. Move to src/lib/utils.ts or create a new .ts file.\"\n  exit 2\nfi\n\nif [[ \"$file_path\" =~ ^src/providers/.*\\.tsx$ ]]; then\n  echo \"Reminder: Provider files belong in src/providers/. Ensure context is properly exported.\"\n  exit 0\nfi\n\nexit 0\n```\n\nThen add to `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"PreToolUse\": [\n      {\n        \"matcher\": \"Write|Edit\",\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/validate-file-placement.sh\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Your Current Project (Entourage Web)\n\nYour CLAUDE.md is already excellent. To maximize enforcement, I recommend:\n\n1. **Enhance your CLAUDE.md** with the explicit \"File Placement Conventions\" section I showed above\n\n2. **Create `.claude/rules/` files** for path-specific guidance:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p .claude/rules\n   touch .claude/rules/components.md\n   touch .claude/rules/file-organization.md\n   ```\n\n3. **Update `.claude/settings.json`** with permission rules to protect `src/components/ui/` files\n\n4. **Optional: Add hooks** if you want automated validation (more powerful but requires maintenance)\n\n---\n\n## Configuration Priority (Highest to Lowest)\n\n1. **Enterprise managed settings** (system-wide policies)\n2. **Command-line flags** (temporary overrides)\n3. **`.claude/settings.local.json`** (your personal project overrides)\n4. **`.claude/settings.json`** (team-shared settings)\n5. **`.claude/rules/*.md`** (path-specific rules, applied automatically)\n6. **`CLAUDE.md`** (instructions Claude reads)\n7. **User settings** `~/.claude/settings.json` (personal global settings)\n\n---\n\n## Key Resources\n\n- **CLAUDE.md documentation**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory.md - Complete guide to project memory\n- **Settings documentation**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings.md - Permission and configuration system\n- **Rules documentation**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory.md#modular-rules-with-claude-rules - Path-specific rules with glob patterns\n- **Hooks documentation**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide.md - Automated enforcement hooks\n- **Skills documentation**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md - For specialized folder conventions (like your `/add-shadcn-component` skill)\n\nYour project already has the right foundation.

Now I have comprehensive information. Let me compile this into a well-organized research document with specific recommendations.\n\n## Summary\n\nAfter researching Next.js and React component organization best practices in 2025, here are the key findings:\n\n**For landing page sections** (Hero, Header, Footer, FAQ, Features, CTA), there's **no universal standard**, but **three main patterns** have emerged:\n\n1. **Colocation within `app/` routes** (Modern, Next.js 13+ recommended)\n2. **`components/sections/`** (Traditional, clear semantics)\n3. **Flat in `components/`** (Simple, works for smaller sites)\n\nThe **2025 consensus** favors **feature-based colocation** for scalability, with **private folders** (`_components/`) for route-specific UI and centralized folders (`components/ui/`, `components/layout/`) for truly shared elements.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1. Next.js Official Recommendations (2025)\n\n**Source**: [Next.js Project Structure Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure)  \n**Relevance**: Official guidance from Vercel/Next.js team  \n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\nNext.js explicitly states it's **\"unopinionated about how you organize and colocate your project files\"** but provides three recommended strategies:\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Store Files Outside `app/`** (Cleanest Separation)\n```\nproject-root/\n├── app/              # Routing only (page.tsx, layout.tsx)\n├── components/       # All UI components\n├── lib/              # Utilities\n└── public/           # Static assets\n```\n**Best for:** Clear separation of routing from components\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Store Files in Root of `app/`**\n```\napp/\n├── page.tsx\n├── layout.tsx\n├── components/       # Shared UI\n├── lib/              # Utilities\n└── blog/\n    └── page.tsx\n```\n**Best for:** Keeping related files together\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Split by Feature** (Recommended for Scale)\n```\napp/\n├── page.tsx\n├── components/       # Global components (Header, Footer)\n├── lib/              # Global utilities\n├── blog/\n│   ├── page.tsx\n│   ├── _components/  # Blog-specific components\n│   └── _lib/         # Blog utilities\n└── shop/\n    ├── page.tsx\n    └── _components/\n```\n**Best for:** Large applications with feature-based organization\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Private folders** (`_folderName`) opt out of routing\n- **Route groups** (`(marketing)`) organize without affecting URLs\n- **Safe colocation**: Only `page.tsx` or `route.ts` files become routable\n\n**For landing page sections specifically:** Next.js doesn't mandate a specific location. You can place Hero, Features, CTA sections in `components/`, colocate them in `app/page/_components/`, or use a hybrid approach.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Kent C. Dodds' Colocation Philosophy\n\n**Source**: [Colocation - Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation)  \n**Relevance**: Influential React architect's principles  \n\n**Core Principle:**  \n> **\"Place code as close to where it's relevant as possible\"**\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Keep files together that change together** - Components used by a single route should live near that route\n2. **Avoid premature abstraction** - Don't extract components to shared folders until they're actually reused\n3. **Localize state** - Keep state near the UI that uses it (better performance + maintainability)\n4. **Colocate tests** - Place `component.test.tsx` next to `component.tsx`\n5. **Avoid \"utils\" black holes** - A single `utils/` folder becomes unmaintainable; organize utilities by feature\n\n**Application to Landing Pages:**\n\nIf your Hero section is only used on the homepage:\n- ✅ Keep it in `app/_components/Hero.tsx` or `app/(home)/_components/Hero.tsx`\n- ❌ Don't prematurely extract to `components/sections/Hero.tsx`\n\nIf Header/Footer are used across multiple pages:\n- ✅ Extract to `components/layout/` or `app/components/`\n- These are genuinely shared\n\n**Exception:** End-to-end tests spanning multiple pages belong at project root.\n\n---\n\n### 3. React Folder Structure Evolution (2025)\n\n**Source**: [React Folder Structure in 5 Steps](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure/) by Robin Wieruch  \n**Relevance**: Progressive scaling approach from simple to complex  \n\n**The 5-Step Progression:**\n\n**Step 1:** Single file (`App.js`) - Fine for prototypes  \n**Step 2:** Multiple files - Split reusable components  \n**Step 3:** Component folders - Each component gets its own directory:\n```\ncomponents/\n├── Button/\n│   ├── Button.tsx\n│   ├── Button.test.tsx\n│   ├── Button.css\n│   └── index.ts\n```\n\n**Step 4:** Technical separation:\n```\nsrc/\n├── components/  # UI components\n├── hooks/       # Custom hooks\n├── context/     # React Context\n├── services/    # API utilities\n```\n\n**Step 5:** Feature-based organization:\n```\nsrc/\n├── components/      # Shared UI (Button, Card)\n├── features/\n│   ├── user/\n│   ├── post/\n│   └── payment/\n```\n\n**Key Principles:**\n- **Avoid nesting deeper than 2 levels**\n- **Use absolute imports** with path aliases (`@/components`)\n- **Start simple, evolve as needed**\n\n**For Landing Pages:**  \nSimple sites (3-5 sections) → Flat `components/` is fine  \nComplex sites (10+ sections, multiple pages) → Feature-based or `components/sections/`\n\n---\n\n### 4. Next.js Colocation Template (Real-World Example)\n\n**Source**: [Next.js Colocation Template](https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-colocation-template)  \n**Relevance**: Production-ready example of modern patterns  \n\n**Structure:**\n```\nsrc/app/\n├── (main)/           # Route group for main site\n│   ├── page.tsx      # Homepage\n│   └── about/\n│       ├── page.tsx\n│       └── _components/\n├── (external)/       # Route group for marketing\n│   └── landing/\n│       ├── page.tsx\n│       └── _components/\n│           ├── Hero.tsx\n│           ├── Features.tsx\n│           └── CTA.tsx\n├── dashboard/\n│   ├── page.tsx\n│   └── _components/\n├── components/       # Global shared components\n│   ├── Header.tsx\n│   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   └── ui/\n└── lib/              # Shared utilities\n```\n\n**Pattern:**\n- **Route-specific sections** in `_components/` folders\n- **Shared layout components** (Header/Footer) in global `components/`\n- **UI primitives** (Button, Card) in `components/ui/`\n\nThis is considered **best practice for 2025** because it:\n- Scales well for medium-large apps\n- Clear boundaries between global and local\n- Prevents bloated component directories\n- Works naturally with Server/Client Components\n\n---\n\n### 5. Popular Boilerplate Patterns\n\n**Source**: [Next.js Landing Page Starter Template](https://github.com/ixartz/Next-JS-Landing-Page-Starter-Template)  \n**Relevance**: 13k+ GitHub stars, widely used  \n\n**Structure (Atomic Design Pattern):**\n```\nsrc/\n├── background/    # Atomic background component\n├── button/        # Atomic button component\n├── cta/           # Atomic CTA section\n├── feature/       # Atomic feature section\n├── footer/        # Atomic footer component\n├── hero/          # Atomic hero section\n├── layout/        # Layout wrappers\n├── navigation/    # Navigation components\n└── pages/         # Next.js pages\n```\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- **Flat structure** - Each component/section at root level\n- **Atomic design** terminology\n- Works well for **landing page templates** where sections are self-contained\n- Simple for small to medium sites\n\n---\n\n**Source**: [SaaS Boilerplate by ixartz](https://github.com/ixartz/SaaS-Boilerplate)  \n**Relevance**: Enterprise-grade, production-ready structure  \n\n**Structure:**\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/                    # Next.js App Router\n│   ├── (marketing)/        # Marketing pages\n│   │   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page\n│   │   ├── pricing/\n│   │   └── about/\n│   └── (app)/              # Authenticated app\n│       └── dashboard/\n├── components/             # Shared UI components\n├── features/               # Feature-specific components\n└── templates/              # Layout templates\n```\n\n**Key Insight:**  \nUses **route groups** `(marketing)` and `(app)` to **separate landing pages from app pages** while keeping components in:\n- `components/` for shared UI\n- `features/` for domain-specific logic\n\n---\n\n### 6. Component Categories Consensus\n\n**Sources**: Multiple ([Wisp CMS](https://www.wisp.blog/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-organizing-your-nextjs-15-project-structure), [DhiWise](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/ultimate-guide-to-organizing-your-nextjs-components-folder), [DEV Community](https://dev.to/bajrayejoon/best-practices-for-organizing-your-nextjs-15-2025-53ji))\n\n**The 2025 Standard Component Hierarchy:**\n\n```\ncomponents/\n├── ui/              # Primitives (Button, Input, Card, Modal)\n├── layout/          # Structural (Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav)\n├── features/        # Domain-specific (LoginForm, DashboardStats)\n└── sections/        # Page sections (Hero, Features, CTA, FAQ)\n```\n\n**Definitions:**\n\n| Category | Purpose | Examples | Reusability |\n|----------|---------|----------|-------------|\n| **ui/** | Basic building blocks | Button, Input, Card, Badge | Highly reusable |\n| **layout/** | Page structure | Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav | Used across pages |\n| **features/** | Business logic | LoginForm, CheckoutFlow | Feature-specific |\n| **sections/** | Page content blocks | Hero, Features, Testimonials, FAQ | Landing page sections |\n\n**Where `sections/` Fits:**\n- **Use `components/sections/`** when sections are reused across multiple pages\n- **Use route colocation** (`app/_components/Hero.tsx`) when sections are page-specific\n- **Hybrid approach:** Keep truly reusable sections in `components/sections/`, page-specific ones colocated\n\n---\n\n## Specific Recommendations for Your Project\n\nBased on your current structure (`src/components/` with Hero, FAQ, FlowSection, etc.), here are tailored recommendations:\n\n### Option 1: Keep Current Flat Structure (Simplest)\n**Current state is fine if:**\n- Landing page is single-page\n- Sections aren't deeply nested\n- Team understands current organization\n\n```\ncomponents/\n├── Header.tsx\n├── Hero.tsx\n├── TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\n├── FlowSection.tsx\n├── BentoFeatures.tsx\n├── FAQ.tsx\n├── SecondaryCTA.tsx\n├── Footer.tsx\n├── ui/\n└── bento/\n```\n\n✅ **Pros:** Simple, no migration needed  \n❌ **Cons:** Can get cluttered with 15+ sections\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: Add `sections/` Subdirectory (Clear Semantics)\n**Better if:**\n- Planning to add more pages\n- Want clear categorization\n- Sections are reusable\n\n```\ncomponents/\n├── layout/\n│   ├── Header.tsx\n│   └── Footer.tsx\n├── sections/\n│   ├── Hero.tsx\n│   ├── TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\n│   ├── FlowSection.tsx\n│   ├── BentoFeatures.tsx\n│   ├── FAQ.tsx\n│   └── SecondaryCTA.tsx\n├── ui/\n└── bento/\n```\n\n✅ **Pros:** Clear categorization, scales to multiple pages  \n❌ **Cons:** Extra folder depth\n\n**Migration:** Move Hero, FAQ, Flow, etc. to `components/sections/`, keep Header/Footer in `components/layout/`\n\n---\n\n### Option 3: Colocation with App Router (Modern Next.js 15+)\n**Best for:**\n- Multi-page sites\n- Feature-based development\n- Large teams\n\n```\napp/\n├── page.tsx                    # Imports from _components/\n├── _components/                # Homepage-specific sections\n│   ├── Hero.tsx\n│   ├── FlowSection.tsx\n│   └── BentoFeatures.tsx\n├── pricing/\n│   ├── page.tsx\n│   └── _components/\n├── components/                 #

Let me compile this into a well-organized research document with specific recommendations.\n\n## Summary\n\nAfter researching Next.js and React component organization best practices in 2025, here are the key findings:\n\n**For landing page sections** (Hero, Header, Footer, FAQ, Features, CTA), there's **no universal standard**, but **three main patterns** have emerged:\n\n1. **Colocation within `app/` routes** (Modern, Next.js 13+ recommended)\n2. **`components/sections/`** (Traditional, clear semantics)\n3. **Flat in `components/`** (Simple, works for smaller sites)\n\nThe **2025 consensus** favors **feature-based colocation** for scalability, with **private folders** (`_components/`) for route-specific UI and centralized folders (`components/ui/`, `components/layout/`) for truly shared elements.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1. Next.js Official Recommendations (2025)\n\n**Source**: [Next.js Project Structure Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure)  \n**Relevance**: Official guidance from Vercel/Next.js team  \n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\nNext.js explicitly states it's **\"unopinionated about how you organize and colocate your project files\"** but provides three recommended strategies:\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Store Files Outside `app/`** (Cleanest Separation)\n```\nproject-root/\n├── app/              # Routing only (page.tsx, layout.tsx)\n├── components/       # All UI components\n├── lib/              # Utilities\n└── public/           # Static assets\n```\n**Best for:** Clear separation of routing from components\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Store Files in Root of `app/`**\n```\napp/\n├── page.tsx\n├── layout.tsx\n├── components/       # Shared UI\n├── lib/              # Utilities\n└── blog/\n    └── page.tsx\n```\n**Best for:** Keeping related files together\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Split by Feature** (Recommended for Scale)\n```\napp/\n├── page.tsx\n├── components/       # Global components (Header, Footer)\n├── lib/              # Global utilities\n├── blog/\n│   ├── page.tsx\n│   ├── _components/  # Blog-specific components\n│   └── _lib/         # Blog utilities\n└── shop/\n    ├── page.tsx\n    └── _components/\n```\n**Best for:** Large applications with feature-based organization\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Private folders** (`_folderName`) opt out of routing\n- **Route groups** (`(marketing)`) organize without affecting URLs\n- **Safe colocation**: Only `page.tsx` or `route.ts` files become routable\n\n**For landing page sections specifically:** Next.js doesn't mandate a specific location. You can place Hero, Features, CTA sections in `components/`, colocate them in `app/page/_components/`, or use a hybrid approach.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Kent C. Dodds' Colocation Philosophy\n\n**Source**: [Colocation - Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation)  \n**Relevance**: Influential React architect's principles  \n\n**Core Principle:**  \n> **\"Place code as close to where it's relevant as possible\"**\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Keep files together that change together** - Components used by a single route should live near that route\n2. **Avoid premature abstraction** - Don't extract components to shared folders until they're actually reused\n3. **Localize state** - Keep state near the UI that uses it (better performance + maintainability)\n4. **Colocate tests** - Place `component.test.tsx` next to `component.tsx`\n5. **Avoid \"utils\" black holes** - A single `utils/` folder becomes unmaintainable; organize utilities by feature\n\n**Application to Landing Pages:**\n\nIf your Hero section is only used on the homepage:\n- ✅ Keep it in `app/_components/Hero.tsx` or `app/(home)/_components/Hero.tsx`\n- ❌ Don't prematurely extract to `components/sections/Hero.tsx`\n\nIf Header/Footer are used across multiple pages:\n- ✅ Extract to `components/layout/` or `app/components/`\n- These are genuinely shared\n\n**Exception:** End-to-end tests spanning multiple pages belong at project root.\n\n---\n\n### 3. React Folder Structure Evolution (2025)\n\n**Source**: [React Folder Structure in 5 Steps](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure/) by Robin Wieruch  \n**Relevance**: Progressive scaling approach from simple to complex  \n\n**The 5-Step Progression:**\n\n**Step 1:** Single file (`App.js`) - Fine for prototypes  \n**Step 2:** Multiple files - Split reusable components  \n**Step 3:** Component folders - Each component gets its own directory:\n```\ncomponents/\n├── Button/\n│   ├── Button.tsx\n│   ├── Button.test.tsx\n│   ├── Button.css\n│   └── index.ts\n```\n\n**Step 4:** Technical separation:\n```\nsrc/\n├── components/  # UI components\n├── hooks/       # Custom hooks\n├── context/     # React Context\n├── services/    # API utilities\n```\n\n**Step 5:** Feature-based organization:\n```\nsrc/\n├── components/      # Shared UI (Button, Card)\n├── features/\n│   ├── user/\n│   ├── post/\n│   └── payment/\n```\n\n**Key Principles:**\n- **Avoid nesting deeper than 2 levels**\n- **Use absolute imports** with path aliases (`@/components`)\n- **Start simple, evolve as needed**\n\n**For Landing Pages:**  \nSimple sites (3-5 sections) → Flat `components/` is fine  \nComplex sites (10+ sections, multiple pages) → Feature-based or `components/sections/`\n\n---\n\n### 4. Next.js Colocation Template (Real-World Example)\n\n**Source**: [Next.js Colocation Template](https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-colocation-template)  \n**Relevance**: Production-ready example of modern patterns  \n\n**Structure:**\n```\nsrc/app/\n├── (main)/           # Route group for main site\n│   ├── page.tsx      # Homepage\n│   └── about/\n│       ├── page.tsx\n│       └── _components/\n├── (external)/       # Route group for marketing\n│   └── landing/\n│       ├── page.tsx\n│       └── _components/\n│           ├── Hero.tsx\n│           ├── Features.tsx\n│           └── CTA.tsx\n├── dashboard/\n│   ├── page.tsx\n│   └── _components/\n├── components/       # Global shared components\n│   ├── Header.tsx\n│   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   └── ui/\n└── lib/              # Shared utilities\n```\n\n**Pattern:**\n- **Route-specific sections** in `_components/` folders\n- **Shared layout components** (Header/Footer) in global `components/`\n- **UI primitives** (Button, Card) in `components/ui/`\n\nThis is considered **best practice for 2025** because it:\n- Scales well for medium-large apps\n- Clear boundaries between global and local\n- Prevents bloated component directories\n- Works naturally with Server/Client Components\n\n---\n\n### 5. Popular Boilerplate Patterns\n\n**Source**: [Next.js Landing Page Starter Template](https://github.com/ixartz/Next-JS-Landing-Page-Starter-Template)  \n**Relevance**: 13k+ GitHub stars, widely used  \n\n**Structure (Atomic Design Pattern):**\n```\nsrc/\n├── background/    # Atomic background component\n├── button/        # Atomic button component\n├── cta/           # Atomic CTA section\n├── feature/       # Atomic feature section\n├── footer/        # Atomic footer component\n├── hero/          # Atomic hero section\n├── layout/        # Layout wrappers\n├── navigation/    # Navigation components\n└── pages/         # Next.js pages\n```\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- **Flat structure** - Each component/section at root level\n- **Atomic design** terminology\n- Works well for **landing page templates** where sections are self-contained\n- Simple for small to medium sites\n\n---\n\n**Source**: [SaaS Boilerplate by ixartz](https://github.com/ixartz/SaaS-Boilerplate)  \n**Relevance**: Enterprise-grade, production-ready structure  \n\n**Structure:**\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/                    # Next.js App Router\n│   ├── (marketing)/        # Marketing pages\n│   │   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page\n│   │   ├── pricing/\n│   │   └── about/\n│   └── (app)/              # Authenticated app\n│       └── dashboard/\n├── components/             # Shared UI components\n├── features/               # Feature-specific components\n└── templates/              # Layout templates\n```\n\n**Key Insight:**  \nUses **route groups** `(marketing)` and `(app)` to **separate landing pages from app pages** while keeping components in:\n- `components/` for shared UI\n- `features/` for domain-specific logic\n\n---\n\n### 6. Component Categories Consensus\n\n**Sources**: Multiple ([Wisp CMS](https://www.wisp.blog/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-organizing-your-nextjs-15-project-structure), [DhiWise](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/ultimate-guide-to-organizing-your-nextjs-components-folder), [DEV Community](https://dev.to/bajrayejoon/best-practices-for-organizing-your-nextjs-15-2025-53ji))\n\n**The 2025 Standard Component Hierarchy:**\n\n```\ncomponents/\n├── ui/              # Primitives (Button, Input, Card, Modal)\n├── layout/          # Structural (Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav)\n├── features/        # Domain-specific (LoginForm, DashboardStats)\n└── sections/        # Page sections (Hero, Features, CTA, FAQ)\n```\n\n**Definitions:**\n\n| Category | Purpose | Examples | Reusability |\n|----------|---------|----------|-------------|\n| **ui/** | Basic building blocks | Button, Input, Card, Badge | Highly reusable |\n| **layout/** | Page structure | Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav | Used across pages |\n| **features/** | Business logic | LoginForm, CheckoutFlow | Feature-specific |\n| **sections/** | Page content blocks | Hero, Features, Testimonials, FAQ | Landing page sections |\n\n**Where `sections/` Fits:**\n- **Use `components/sections/`** when sections are reused across multiple pages\n- **Use route colocation** (`app/_components/Hero.tsx`) when sections are page-specific\n- **Hybrid approach:** Keep truly reusable sections in `components/sections/`, page-specific ones colocated\n\n---\n\n## Specific Recommendations for Your Project\n\nBased on your current structure (`src/components/` with Hero, FAQ, FlowSection, etc.), here are tailored recommendations:\n\n### Option 1: Keep Current Flat Structure (Simplest)\n**Current state is fine if:**\n- Landing page is single-page\n- Sections aren't deeply nested\n- Team understands current organization\n\n```\ncomponents/\n├── Header.tsx\n├── Hero.tsx\n├── TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\n├── FlowSection.tsx\n├── BentoFeatures.tsx\n├── FAQ.tsx\n├── SecondaryCTA.tsx\n├── Footer.tsx\n├── ui/\n└── bento/\n```\n\n✅ **Pros:** Simple, no migration needed  \n❌ **Cons:** Can get cluttered with 15+ sections\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: Add `sections/` Subdirectory (Clear Semantics)\n**Better if:**\n- Planning to add more pages\n- Want clear categorization\n- Sections are reusable\n\n```\ncomponents/\n├── layout/\n│   ├── Header.tsx\n│   └── Footer.tsx\n├── sections/\n│   ├── Hero.tsx\n│   ├── TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\n│   ├── FlowSection.tsx\n│   ├── BentoFeatures.tsx\n│   ├── FAQ.tsx\n│   └── SecondaryCTA.tsx\n├── ui/\n└── bento/\n```\n\n✅ **Pros:** Clear categorization, scales to multiple pages  \n❌ **Cons:** Extra folder depth\n\n**Migration:** Move Hero, FAQ, Flow, etc. to `components/sections/`, keep Header/Footer in `components/layout/`\n\n---\n\n### Option 3: Colocation with App Router (Modern Next.js 15+)\n**Best for:**\n- Multi-page sites\n- Feature-based development\n- Large teams\n\n```\napp/\n├── page.tsx                    #

All imports resolve correctly: `pnpm build`\n2. App renders without errors: `pnpm dev`\n3. TypeScript has no errors: `pnpm typecheck` (if available) or build succeeds\n4. Claude Code sessions follow placement rules when creating new files\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- NOT adding route groups `(marketing)/` (single page, not needed yet)\n- NOT adding `features/` directory (no business logic yet)\n- NOT adding `instrumentation.ts` or `proxy.ts` (no observability/auth yet)\n- NOT modifying any component logic, only moving files\n- NOT changing the ui/ or bento/ directories\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nMove files incrementally, updating imports after each move. Add Claude Code enforcement rules last to avoid conflicts during migration.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Create Directory Structure\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate the new directories and barrel export files.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create providers directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/providers\n```\n\n**File**: `src/providers/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { ThemeProvider } from \"./ThemeProvider\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Create layout directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/header\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/footer\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Header } from \"./header\";\nexport { Footer } from \"./footer\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/header/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Header } from \"./Header\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/footer/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Footer } from \"./Footer\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Create sections directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/hero\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/flow-section\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/bento-features\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/team-credentials\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/faq\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/secondary-cta\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Hero } from \"./hero\";\nexport { FlowSection } from \"./flow-section\";\nexport { BentoFeatures } from \"./bento-features\";\nexport { TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./team-credentials\";\nexport { FAQ } from \"./faq\";\nexport { SecondaryCTA } from \"./secondary-cta\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/hero/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FlowSection } from \"./FlowSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/bento-features/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as BentoFeatures } from \"./BentoFeatures\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/team-credentials/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./TeamCredentialsSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/faq/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FAQ } from \"./FAQ\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/secondary-cta/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as SecondaryCTA } from \"./SecondaryCTA\";\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All directories created: `ls -la src/providers src/components/layout src/components/sections`\n- [ ] All index.ts files exist (will have import errors until Phase 2)\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Directory structure matches plan\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Move Files and Update Imports\n\n### Overview\n\nMove component files to their new locations and update all import statements.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Move ThemeProvider to providers/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/layout.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/components/ThemeProvider\";\n\n// After\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Move Header and Footer to layout/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Header.tsx src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx\nmv src/components/Footer.tsx src/components/layout/footer/Footer.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Header from \"@/components/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/Footer\";\n\n// After\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Move section components\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Hero.tsx src/components/sections/hero/Hero.tsx\nmv src/components/FlowSection.tsx src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx\nmv src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx src/components/sections/bento-features/BentoFeatures.tsx\nmv src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx src/components/sections/team-credentials/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\nmv src/components/FAQ.tsx src/components/sections/faq/FAQ.tsx\nmv src/components/SecondaryCTA.tsx src/components/sections/secondary-cta/SecondaryCTA.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Hero from \"@/components/Hero\";\nimport TeamCredentialsSection from \"@/components/TeamCredentialsSection\";\nimport FlowSection from \"@/components/FlowSection\";\nimport BentoFeatures from \"@/components/BentoFeatures\";\nimport SecondaryCTA from \"@/components/SecondaryCTA\";\nimport FAQ from \"@/components/FAQ\";\n\n// After\nimport {\n  Hero,\n  FlowSection,\n  BentoFeatures,\n  TeamCredentialsSection,\n  FAQ,\n  SecondaryCTA,\n} from \"@/components/sections\";\n```\n\n#### 4.

Create components rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/components.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/components/**/*.{tsx,ts}\n---\n\n# Component Development Rules\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nComponents must be placed in the correct directory based on their type:\n\n| Type | Location | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Layout | `components/layout/[name]/` | Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav |\n| Sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | Page content blocks (Hero, FAQ, CTA) |\n| UI Primitives | `components/ui/` | ShadCN and design system primitives |\n| Feature-specific | `components/[feature]/` | Domain-specific (bento/, etc.) |\n| Utilities | `components/` root | Small shared utilities (Icon, Logo) |\n\n## File Organization Pattern\n\nEach component directory follows this pattern:\n```\ncomponents/sections/hero/\n├── Hero.tsx        # Main component (PascalCase)\n└── index.ts        # Barrel export\n```\n\nIndex file format:\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n## ShadCN Component Rules\n\n- **NEVER modify** files in `components/ui/` directly\n- Install via: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n- Create wrappers in `components/` root for brand customization\n\n## When Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style) → `components/sections/[name]/`\n2. **Layout element** (Header, Footer, Nav) → `components/layout/[name]/`\n3. **Design primitive** (Button, Card, Input) → Use ShadCN or `components/ui/`\n4. **Small utility** (Icon, Logo) → `components/` root\n\n## Styling Rules\n\n- Always use `rounded-none` (no border radius)\n- Always include dark mode: `dark:` variants\n- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n- Follow design system in `docs/design-system.md`\n```\n\n#### 2. Create file organization rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/file-organization.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/**/*.{tsx,ts,js}\n---\n\n# File Organization Rules\n\n## Required Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/              # Next.js App Router ONLY\n├── components/       # React components\n│   ├── layout/       # Structural (Header, Footer)\n│   ├── sections/     # Page sections (Hero, FAQ)\n│   ├── ui/           # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   └── [feature]/    # Feature-specific (bento/)\n├── providers/        # React Context providers\n├── lib/              # Utilities and helpers\n├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks (when needed)\n└── types/            # TypeScript definitions (when needed)\n```\n\n## File Placement Rules\n\n| File Type | Location | Example |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Page routes | `app/[route]/page.tsx` | `app/about/page.tsx` |\n| Layouts | `app/[route]/layout.tsx` | `app/layout.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/[Name]Provider.tsx` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/[name].ts` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n| Custom hooks | `hooks/use[Name].ts` | `hooks/useAnimation.ts` |\n| Type definitions | `types/[domain].ts` | `types/api.ts` |\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n- **Components**: PascalCase (`DataVaultCard.tsx`)\n- **Utilities**: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)\n- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAnimation.ts`)\n- **Directories**: kebab-case (`flow-section/`)\n\n## Import Patterns\n\nUse barrel exports from index.ts files:\n\n```typescript\n// Good - uses barrel export\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\nimport { Hero, FAQ } from \"@/components/sections\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n\n// Avoid - direct file imports for organized components\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/header/Header\";\n```\n\n## Protected Directories\n\n- `components/ui/` - ShadCN primitives, never modify directly\n- `app/fonts/` - Font files, do not add components here\n```\n\n#### 3. Update settings.json with protection rules\n\n**File**: `.claude/settings.json`\n\nAdd to existing permissions:\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"deny\": [\n      \"Edit(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Write(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Edit(./src/components/ui/**)\",\n      \"Write(./src/components/ui/**)\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"hooks\": {\n    // ... existing hooks unchanged\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Rule files exist: `ls -la .claude/rules/`\n- [ ] Settings.json is valid JSON: `cat .claude/settings.json | jq .`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Start new Claude Code session and verify rules are loaded\n- [ ] Ask Claude to create a new section component - should go to `components/sections/`\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Update Documentation\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate CLAUDE.md and related documentation to reflect the new structure.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update CLAUDE.md Project Structure section\n\n**File**: `CLAUDE.md`\n\nReplace the Project Structure section with:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/\n│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout, fonts, providers\n│   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page (orchestrates sections)\n│   ├── globals.css     # CSS variables, base styles\n│   └── fonts/          # Local font files\n├── components/\n│   ├── layout/         # Structural components\n│   │   ├── header/     # Header component\n│   │   └── footer/     # Footer component\n│   ├── sections/       # Page content blocks\n│   │   ├── hero/\n│   │   ├── flow-section/\n│   │   ├── bento-features/\n│   │   ├── team-credentials/\n│   │   ├── faq/\n│   │   └── secondary-cta/\n│   ├── ui/             # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── bento/          # Bento grid card components\n│   ├── Icon.tsx        # Icon utility\n│   ├── Logo.tsx        # Logo component\n│   └── ThemeToggle.tsx # Theme toggle button\n├── providers/\n│   └── ThemeProvider.tsx  # Theme context\n├── lib/\n│   └── utils.ts        # cn() utility\ndocs/\n└── design-system.md    # Complete design guide\nthoughts/shared/\n├── plans/              # Implementation plans\n├── research/           # Analysis documents\n└── handoffs/           # Session handoffs\n```\n\n## File Placement Conventions\n\n| Component Type | Location | Example |\n|----------------|----------|---------|\n| Page sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | `sections/hero/Hero.tsx` |\n| Layout (Header/Footer) | `components/layout/[name]/` | `layout/header/Header.tsx` |\n| UI primitives | `components/ui/` | `ui/button.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n\n### Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/sections/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n2. **Layout component** (Header, Footer, Nav):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/layout/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n3. **ShadCN component**:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component]\n   # Creates in components/ui/ - DO NOT MODIFY\n   # Create wrapper in components/ if needed\n   ```\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md is valid markdown\n- [ ] Build still succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects new structure\n- [ ] New Claude Code sessions understand file placement\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated Tests:\n- Build succeeds without errors\n- Dev server starts correctly\n- All imports resolve\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `pnpm dev` and verify landing page renders\n2. Check all sections are visible and styled correctly\n3. Verify theme toggle works\n4. Verify Header sticky behavior\n5. Verify Footer renders at bottom\n6.

All imports resolve correctly: `pnpm build`\n2. App renders without errors: `pnpm dev`\n3. TypeScript has no errors: `pnpm typecheck` (if available) or build succeeds\n4. Claude Code sessions follow placement rules when creating new files\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- NOT adding route groups `(marketing)/` (single page, not needed yet)\n- NOT adding `features/` directory (no business logic yet)\n- NOT adding `instrumentation.ts` or `proxy.ts` (no observability/auth yet)\n- NOT modifying any component logic, only moving files\n- NOT changing the ui/ or bento/ directories\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nMove files incrementally, updating imports after each move. Add Claude Code enforcement rules last to avoid conflicts during migration.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Create Directory Structure\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate the new directories and barrel export files.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create providers directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/providers\n```\n\n**File**: `src/providers/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { ThemeProvider } from \"./ThemeProvider\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Create layout directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/header\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/footer\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Header } from \"./header\";\nexport { Footer } from \"./footer\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/header/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Header } from \"./Header\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/footer/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Footer } from \"./Footer\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Create sections directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/hero\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/flow-section\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/bento-features\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/team-credentials\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/faq\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/secondary-cta\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Hero } from \"./hero\";\nexport { FlowSection } from \"./flow-section\";\nexport { BentoFeatures } from \"./bento-features\";\nexport { TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./team-credentials\";\nexport { FAQ } from \"./faq\";\nexport { SecondaryCTA } from \"./secondary-cta\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/hero/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FlowSection } from \"./FlowSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/bento-features/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as BentoFeatures } from \"./BentoFeatures\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/team-credentials/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./TeamCredentialsSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/faq/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FAQ } from \"./FAQ\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/secondary-cta/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as SecondaryCTA } from \"./SecondaryCTA\";\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All directories created: `ls -la src/providers src/components/layout src/components/sections`\n- [ ] All index.ts files exist (will have import errors until Phase 2)\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Directory structure matches plan\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Move Files and Update Imports\n\n### Overview\n\nMove component files to their new locations and update all import statements.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Move ThemeProvider to providers/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/layout.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/components/ThemeProvider\";\n\n// After\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Move Header and Footer to layout/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Header.tsx src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx\nmv src/components/Footer.tsx src/components/layout/footer/Footer.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Header from \"@/components/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/Footer\";\n\n// After\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Move section components\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Hero.tsx src/components/sections/hero/Hero.tsx\nmv src/components/FlowSection.tsx src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx\nmv src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx src/components/sections/bento-features/BentoFeatures.tsx\nmv src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx src/components/sections/team-credentials/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\nmv src/components/FAQ.tsx src/components/sections/faq/FAQ.tsx\nmv src/components/SecondaryCTA.tsx src/components/sections/secondary-cta/SecondaryCTA.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Hero from \"@/components/Hero\";\nimport TeamCredentialsSection from \"@/components/TeamCredentialsSection\";\nimport FlowSection from \"@/components/FlowSection\";\nimport BentoFeatures from \"@/components/BentoFeatures\";\nimport SecondaryCTA from \"@/components/SecondaryCTA\";\nimport FAQ from \"@/components/FAQ\";\n\n// After\nimport {\n  Hero,\n  FlowSection,\n  BentoFeatures,\n  TeamCredentialsSection,\n  FAQ,\n  SecondaryCTA,\n} from \"@/components/sections\";\n```\n\n#### 4. Update internal imports within moved files\n\nCheck each moved file for imports that reference other moved files:\n\n**Header.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- ThemeToggle (stays at root, update if needed)\n- Logo (stays at root)\n\n**BentoFeatures.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- bento/ components (path unchanged, should work)\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] Dev server starts: `pnpm dev`\n- [ ] No import errors in terminal\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Landing page renders correctly at http://localhost:3000\n- [ ] All sections visible (Hero, Flow, Features, FAQ, etc.)\n- [ ] Header and Footer render\n- [ ] Theme toggle works\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation that the site renders correctly before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add Claude Code Enforcement Rules\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate `.claude/rules/` files to enforce folder structure in future Claude Code sessions.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create components rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/components.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/components/**/*.{tsx,ts}\n---\n\n# Component Development Rules\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nComponents must be placed in the correct directory based on their type:\n\n| Type | Location | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Layout | `components/layout/[name]/` | Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav |\n| Sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | Page content blocks (Hero, FAQ, CTA) |\n| UI Primitives | `components/ui/` | ShadCN and design system primitives |\n| Feature-specific | `components/[feature]/` | Domain-specific (bento/, etc.) |\n| Utilities | `components/` root | Small shared utilities (Icon, Logo) |\n\n## File Organization Pattern\n\nEach component directory follows this pattern:\n```\ncomponents/sections/hero/\n├── Hero.tsx        # Main component (PascalCase)\n└── index.ts        # Barrel export\n```\n\nIndex file format:\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n## ShadCN Component Rules\n\n- **NEVER modify** files in `components/ui/` directly\n- Install via: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n- Create wrappers in `components/` root for brand customization\n\n## When Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style) → `components/sections/[name]/`\n2. **Layout element** (Header, Footer, Nav) → `components/layout/[name]/`\n3. **Design primitive** (Button, Card, Input) → Use ShadCN or `components/ui/`\n4. **Small utility** (Icon, Logo) → `components/` root\n\n## Styling Rules\n\n- Always use `rounded-none` (no border radius)\n- Always include dark mode: `dark:` variants\n- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n- Follow design system in `docs/design-system.md`\n```\n\n#### 2. Create file organization rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/file-organization.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/**/*.{tsx,ts,js}\n---\n\n# File Organization Rules\n\n## Required Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/              # Next.js App Router ONLY\n├── components/       # React components\n│   ├── layout/       # Structural (Header, Footer)\n│   ├── sections/     # Page sections (Hero, FAQ)\n│   ├── ui/           # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   └── [feature]/    # Feature-specific (bento/)\n├── providers/        # React Context providers\n├── lib/              # Utilities and helpers\n├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks (when needed)\n└── types/            # TypeScript definitions (when needed)\n```\n\n## File Placement Rules\n\n| File Type | Location | Example |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Page routes | `app/[route]/page.tsx` | `app/about/page.tsx` |\n| Layouts | `app/[route]/layout.tsx` | `app/layout.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/[Name]Provider.tsx` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/[name].ts` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n| Custom hooks | `hooks/use[Name].ts` | `hooks/useAnimation.ts` |\n| Type definitions | `types/[domain].ts` | `types/api.ts` |\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n- **Components**: PascalCase (`DataVaultCard.tsx`)\n- **Utilities**: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)\n- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAnimation.ts`)\n- **Directories**: kebab-case (`flow-section/`)\n\n## Import Patterns\n\nUse barrel exports from index.ts files:\n\n```typescript\n// Good - uses barrel export\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\nimport { Hero, FAQ } from \"@/components/sections\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n\n// Avoid - direct file imports for organized components\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/header/Header\";\n```\n\n## Protected Directories\n\n- `components/ui/` - ShadCN primitives, never modify directly\n- `app/fonts/` - Font files, do not add components here\n```\n\n#### 3. Update settings.json with protection rules\n\n**File**: `.claude/settings.json`\n\nAdd to existing permissions:\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"deny\": [\n      \"Edit(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Write(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Edit(./src/components/ui/**)\",\n      \"Write(./src/components/ui/**)\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"hooks\": {\n    // ... existing hooks unchanged\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Rule files exist: `ls -la .claude/rules/`\n- [ ] Settings.json is valid JSON: `cat .claude/settings.json | jq .`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Start new Claude Code session and verify rules are loaded\n- [ ] Ask Claude to create a new section component - should go to `components/sections/`\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Update Documentation\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate CLAUDE.md and related documentation to reflect the new structure.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update CLAUDE.md Project Structure section\n\n**File**: `CLAUDE.md`\n\nReplace the Project Structure section with:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/\n│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout, fonts, providers\n│   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page (orchestrates sections)\n│   ├── globals.css     # CSS variables, base styles\n│   └── fonts/          # Local font files\n├── components/\n│   ├── layout/         # Structural components\n│   │   ├── header/     # Header component\n│   │   └── footer/     # Footer component\n│   ├── sections/       # Page content blocks\n│   │   ├── hero/\n│   │   ├── flow-section/\n│   │   ├── bento-features/\n│   │   ├── team-credentials/\n│   │   ├── faq/\n│   │   └── secondary-cta/\n│   ├── ui/             # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── bento/          # Bento grid card components\n│   ├── Icon.tsx        # Icon utility\n│   ├── Logo.tsx        # Logo component\n│   └── ThemeToggle.tsx # Theme toggle button\n├── providers/\n│   └── ThemeProvider.tsx  # Theme context\n├── lib/\n│   └── utils.ts        # cn() utility\ndocs/\n└── design-system.md    # Complete design guide\nthoughts/shared/\n├── plans/              # Implementation plans\n├── research/           # Analysis documents\n└── handoffs/           # Session handoffs\n```\n\n## File Placement Conventions\n\n| Component Type | Location | Example |\n|----------------|----------|---------|\n| Page sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | `sections/hero/Hero.tsx` |\n| Layout (Header/Footer) | `components/layout/[name]/` | `layout/header/Header.tsx` |\n| UI primitives | `components/ui/` | `ui/button.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n\n### Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/sections/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n2. **Layout component** (Header, Footer, Nav):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/layout/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n3. **ShadCN component**:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component]\n   # Creates in components/ui/ - DO NOT MODIFY\n   # Create wrapper in components/ if needed\n   ```\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md is valid markdown\n- [ ] Build still succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects new structure\n- [ ] New Claude Code sessions understand file placement\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated Tests:\n- Build succeeds without errors\n- Dev server starts correctly\n- All imports resolve\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `pnpm dev` and verify landing page renders\n2. Check all sections are visible and styled correctly\n3. Verify theme toggle works\n4. Verify Header sticky behavior\n5. Verify Footer renders at bottom\n6. Start new Claude Code session and ask it to create a component\n\n## References\n\n- Research document: `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-26-nextjs-folder-structure-comparison.md`\n- NextJS 16 folder structure guidelines (provided by user)\n- Claude Code documentation for rules and settings\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n- **Pause for human verification**: After completing all automated verification for a phase, pause and inform the human that the phase is ready for manual testing. Use this format:\n  ```\n  Phase [N] Complete - Ready for Manual Verification\n\n  Automated verification passed:\n  - [List automated checks that passed]\n\n  Please perform the manual verification steps listed in the plan:\n  - [List manual verification items from the plan]\n\n  Let me know when manual testing is complete so I can proceed to Phase [N+1].\n  ```\n\nIf instructed to execute multiple phases consecutively, skip the pause until the last phase. Otherwise, assume you are just doing one phase.\n\ndo not check off items in the manual testing steps until confirmed by the user.\n\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"21049d7f-8832-44cb-8716-f5a38b846a00","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:49:53.184Z"}

All imports resolve correctly: `pnpm build`\n2. App renders without errors: `pnpm dev`\n3. TypeScript has no errors: `pnpm typecheck` (if available) or build succeeds\n4. Claude Code sessions follow placement rules when creating new files\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- NOT adding route groups `(marketing)/` (single page, not needed yet)\n- NOT adding `features/` directory (no business logic yet)\n- NOT adding `instrumentation.ts` or `proxy.ts` (no observability/auth yet)\n- NOT modifying any component logic, only moving files\n- NOT changing the ui/ or bento/ directories\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nMove files incrementally, updating imports after each move. Add Claude Code enforcement rules last to avoid conflicts during migration.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Create Directory Structure\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate the new directories and barrel export files.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create providers directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/providers\n```\n\n**File**: `src/providers/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { ThemeProvider } from \"./ThemeProvider\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Create layout directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/header\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/footer\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Header } from \"./header\";\nexport { Footer } from \"./footer\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/header/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Header } from \"./Header\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/footer/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Footer } from \"./Footer\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Create sections directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/hero\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/flow-section\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/bento-features\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/team-credentials\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/faq\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/secondary-cta\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Hero } from \"./hero\";\nexport { FlowSection } from \"./flow-section\";\nexport { BentoFeatures } from \"./bento-features\";\nexport { TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./team-credentials\";\nexport { FAQ } from \"./faq\";\nexport { SecondaryCTA } from \"./secondary-cta\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/hero/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FlowSection } from \"./FlowSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/bento-features/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as BentoFeatures } from \"./BentoFeatures\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/team-credentials/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./TeamCredentialsSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/faq/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FAQ } from \"./FAQ\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/secondary-cta/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as SecondaryCTA } from \"./SecondaryCTA\";\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All directories created: `ls -la src/providers src/components/layout src/components/sections`\n- [ ] All index.ts files exist (will have import errors until Phase 2)\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Directory structure matches plan\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Move Files and Update Imports\n\n### Overview\n\nMove component files to their new locations and update all import statements.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Move ThemeProvider to providers/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/layout.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/components/ThemeProvider\";\n\n// After\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Move Header and Footer to layout/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Header.tsx src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx\nmv src/components/Footer.tsx src/components/layout/footer/Footer.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Header from \"@/components/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/Footer\";\n\n// After\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Move section components\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Hero.tsx src/components/sections/hero/Hero.tsx\nmv src/components/FlowSection.tsx src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx\nmv src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx src/components/sections/bento-features/BentoFeatures.tsx\nmv src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx src/components/sections/team-credentials/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\nmv src/components/FAQ.tsx src/components/sections/faq/FAQ.tsx\nmv src/components/SecondaryCTA.tsx src/components/sections/secondary-cta/SecondaryCTA.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Hero from \"@/components/Hero\";\nimport TeamCredentialsSection from \"@/components/TeamCredentialsSection\";\nimport FlowSection from \"@/components/FlowSection\";\nimport BentoFeatures from \"@/components/BentoFeatures\";\nimport SecondaryCTA from \"@/components/SecondaryCTA\";\nimport FAQ from \"@/components/FAQ\";\n\n// After\nimport {\n  Hero,\n  FlowSection,\n  BentoFeatures,\n  TeamCredentialsSection,\n  FAQ,\n  SecondaryCTA,\n} from \"@/components/sections\";\n```\n\n#### 4. Update internal imports within moved files\n\nCheck each moved file for imports that reference other moved files:\n\n**Header.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- ThemeToggle (stays at root, update if needed)\n- Logo (stays at root)\n\n**BentoFeatures.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- bento/ components (path unchanged, should work)\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] Dev server starts: `pnpm dev`\n- [ ] No import errors in terminal\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Landing page renders correctly at http://localhost:3000\n- [ ] All sections visible (Hero, Flow, Features, FAQ, etc.)\n- [ ] Header and Footer render\n- [ ] Theme toggle works\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation that the site renders correctly before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add Claude Code Enforcement Rules\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate `.claude/rules/` files to enforce folder structure in future Claude Code sessions.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create components rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/components.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/components/**/*.{tsx,ts}\n---\n\n# Component Development Rules\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nComponents must be placed in the correct directory based on their type:\n\n| Type | Location | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Layout | `components/layout/[name]/` | Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav |\n| Sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | Page content blocks (Hero, FAQ, CTA) |\n| UI Primitives | `components/ui/` | ShadCN and design system primitives |\n| Feature-specific | `components/[feature]/` | Domain-specific (bento/, etc.) |\n| Utilities | `components/` root | Small shared utilities (Icon, Logo) |\n\n## File Organization Pattern\n\nEach component directory follows this pattern:\n```\ncomponents/sections/hero/\n├── Hero.tsx        # Main component (PascalCase)\n└── index.ts        # Barrel export\n```\n\nIndex file format:\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n## ShadCN Component Rules\n\n- **NEVER modify** files in `components/ui/` directly\n- Install via: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n- Create wrappers in `components/` root for brand customization\n\n## When Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style) → `components/sections/[name]/`\n2. **Layout element** (Header, Footer, Nav) → `components/layout/[name]/`\n3. **Design primitive** (Button, Card, Input) → Use ShadCN or `components/ui/`\n4. **Small utility** (Icon, Logo) → `components/` root\n\n## Styling Rules\n\n- Always use `rounded-none` (no border radius)\n- Always include dark mode: `dark:` variants\n- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n- Follow design system in `docs/design-system.md`\n```\n\n#### 2. Create file organization rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/file-organization.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/**/*.{tsx,ts,js}\n---\n\n# File Organization Rules\n\n## Required Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/              # Next.js App Router ONLY\n├── components/       # React components\n│   ├── layout/       # Structural (Header, Footer)\n│   ├── sections/     # Page sections (Hero, FAQ)\n│   ├── ui/           # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   └── [feature]/    # Feature-specific (bento/)\n├── providers/        # React Context providers\n├── lib/              # Utilities and helpers\n├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks (when needed)\n└── types/            # TypeScript definitions (when needed)\n```\n\n## File Placement Rules\n\n| File Type | Location | Example |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Page routes | `app/[route]/page.tsx` | `app/about/page.tsx` |\n| Layouts | `app/[route]/layout.tsx` | `app/layout.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/[Name]Provider.tsx` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/[name].ts` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n| Custom hooks | `hooks/use[Name].ts` | `hooks/useAnimation.ts` |\n| Type definitions | `types/[domain].ts` | `types/api.ts` |\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n- **Components**: PascalCase (`DataVaultCard.tsx`)\n- **Utilities**: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)\n- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAnimation.ts`)\n- **Directories**: kebab-case (`flow-section/`)\n\n## Import Patterns\n\nUse barrel exports from index.ts files:\n\n```typescript\n// Good - uses barrel export\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\nimport { Hero, FAQ } from \"@/components/sections\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n\n// Avoid - direct file imports for organized components\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/header/Header\";\n```\n\n## Protected Directories\n\n- `components/ui/` - ShadCN primitives, never modify directly\n- `app/fonts/` - Font files, do not add components here\n```\n\n#### 3. Update settings.json with protection rules\n\n**File**: `.claude/settings.json`\n\nAdd to existing permissions:\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"deny\": [\n      \"Edit(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Write(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Edit(./src/components/ui/**)\",\n      \"Write(./src/components/ui/**)\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"hooks\": {\n    // ... existing hooks unchanged\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Rule files exist: `ls -la .claude/rules/`\n- [ ] Settings.json is valid JSON: `cat .claude/settings.json | jq .`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Start new Claude Code session and verify rules are loaded\n- [ ] Ask Claude to create a new section component - should go to `components/sections/`\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Update Documentation\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate CLAUDE.md and related documentation to reflect the new structure.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update CLAUDE.md Project Structure section\n\n**File**: `CLAUDE.md`\n\nReplace the Project Structure section with:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/\n│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout, fonts, providers\n│   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page (orchestrates sections)\n│   ├── globals.css     # CSS variables, base styles\n│   └── fonts/          # Local font files\n├── components/\n│   ├── layout/         # Structural components\n│   │   ├── header/     # Header component\n│   │   └── footer/     # Footer component\n│   ├── sections/       # Page content blocks\n│   │   ├── hero/\n│   │   ├── flow-section/\n│   │   ├── bento-features/\n│   │   ├── team-credentials/\n│   │   ├── faq/\n│   │   └── secondary-cta/\n│   ├── ui/             # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── bento/          # Bento grid card components\n│   ├── Icon.tsx        # Icon utility\n│   ├── Logo.tsx        # Logo component\n│   └── ThemeToggle.tsx # Theme toggle button\n├── providers/\n│   └── ThemeProvider.tsx  # Theme context\n├── lib/\n│   └── utils.ts        # cn() utility\ndocs/\n└── design-system.md    # Complete design guide\nthoughts/shared/\n├── plans/              # Implementation plans\n├── research/           # Analysis documents\n└── handoffs/           # Session handoffs\n```\n\n## File Placement Conventions\n\n| Component Type | Location | Example |\n|----------------|----------|---------|\n| Page sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | `sections/hero/Hero.tsx` |\n| Layout (Header/Footer) | `components/layout/[name]/` | `layout/header/Header.tsx` |\n| UI primitives | `components/ui/` | `ui/button.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n\n### Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/sections/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n2. **Layout component** (Header, Footer, Nav):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/layout/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n3. **ShadCN component**:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component]\n   # Creates in components/ui/ - DO NOT MODIFY\n   # Create wrapper in components/ if needed\n   ```\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md is valid markdown\n- [ ] Build still succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects new structure\n- [ ] New Claude Code sessions understand file placement\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated Tests:\n- Build succeeds without errors\n- Dev server starts correctly\n- All imports resolve\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `pnpm dev` and verify landing page renders\n2. Check all sections are visible and styled correctly\n3. Verify theme toggle works\n4. Verify Header sticky behavior\n5. Verify Footer renders at bottom\n6. Start new Claude Code session and ask it to create a component\n\n## References\n\n- Research document: `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-26-nextjs-folder-structure-comparison.md`\n- NextJS 16 folder structure guidelines (provided by user)\n- Claude Code documentation for rules and settings\n","numLines":600,"startLine":1,"totalLines":600}}}

All imports resolve correctly: `pnpm build`\n2. App renders without errors: `pnpm dev`\n3. TypeScript has no errors: `pnpm typecheck` (if available) or build succeeds\n4. Claude Code sessions follow placement rules when creating new files\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- NOT adding route groups `(marketing)/` (single page, not needed yet)\n- NOT adding `features/` directory (no business logic yet)\n- NOT adding `instrumentation.ts` or `proxy.ts` (no observability/auth yet)\n- NOT modifying any component logic, only moving files\n- NOT changing the ui/ or bento/ directories\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nMove files incrementally, updating imports after each move. Add Claude Code enforcement rules last to avoid conflicts during migration.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Create Directory Structure\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate the new directories and barrel export files.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create providers directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/providers\n```\n\n**File**: `src/providers/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { ThemeProvider } from \"./ThemeProvider\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Create layout directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/header\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/footer\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Header } from \"./header\";\nexport { Footer } from \"./footer\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/header/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Header } from \"./Header\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/footer/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Footer } from \"./Footer\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Create sections directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/hero\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/flow-section\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/bento-features\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/team-credentials\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/faq\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/secondary-cta\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Hero } from \"./hero\";\nexport { FlowSection } from \"./flow-section\";\nexport { BentoFeatures } from \"./bento-features\";\nexport { TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./team-credentials\";\nexport { FAQ } from \"./faq\";\nexport { SecondaryCTA } from \"./secondary-cta\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/hero/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FlowSection } from \"./FlowSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/bento-features/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as BentoFeatures } from \"./BentoFeatures\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/team-credentials/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./TeamCredentialsSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/faq/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FAQ } from \"./FAQ\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/secondary-cta/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as SecondaryCTA } from \"./SecondaryCTA\";\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All directories created: `ls -la src/providers src/components/layout src/components/sections`\n- [ ] All index.ts files exist (will have import errors until Phase 2)\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Directory structure matches plan\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Move Files and Update Imports\n\n### Overview\n\nMove component files to their new locations and update all import statements.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Move ThemeProvider to providers/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/layout.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/components/ThemeProvider\";\n\n// After\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Move Header and Footer to layout/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Header.tsx src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx\nmv src/components/Footer.tsx src/components/layout/footer/Footer.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Header from \"@/components/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/Footer\";\n\n// After\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Move section components\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Hero.tsx src/components/sections/hero/Hero.tsx\nmv src/components/FlowSection.tsx src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx\nmv src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx src/components/sections/bento-features/BentoFeatures.tsx\nmv src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx src/components/sections/team-credentials/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\nmv src/components/FAQ.tsx src/components/sections/faq/FAQ.tsx\nmv src/components/SecondaryCTA.tsx src/components/sections/secondary-cta/SecondaryCTA.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Hero from \"@/components/Hero\";\nimport TeamCredentialsSection from \"@/components/TeamCredentialsSection\";\nimport FlowSection from \"@/components/FlowSection\";\nimport BentoFeatures from \"@/components/BentoFeatures\";\nimport SecondaryCTA from \"@/components/SecondaryCTA\";\nimport FAQ from \"@/components/FAQ\";\n\n// After\nimport {\n  Hero,\n  FlowSection,\n  BentoFeatures,\n  TeamCredentialsSection,\n  FAQ,\n  SecondaryCTA,\n} from \"@/components/sections\";\n```\n\n#### 4. Update internal imports within moved files\n\nCheck each moved file for imports that reference other moved files:\n\n**Header.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- ThemeToggle (stays at root, update if needed)\n- Logo (stays at root)\n\n**BentoFeatures.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- bento/ components (path unchanged, should work)\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] Dev server starts: `pnpm dev`\n- [ ] No import errors in terminal\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Landing page renders correctly at http://localhost:3000\n- [ ] All sections visible (Hero, Flow, Features, FAQ, etc.)\n- [ ] Header and Footer render\n- [ ] Theme toggle works\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation that the site renders correctly before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add Claude Code Enforcement Rules\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate `.claude/rules/` files to enforce folder structure in future Claude Code sessions.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create components rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/components.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/components/**/*.{tsx,ts}\n---\n\n# Component Development Rules\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nComponents must be placed in the correct directory based on their type:\n\n| Type | Location | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Layout | `components/layout/[name]/` | Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav |\n| Sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | Page content blocks (Hero, FAQ, CTA) |\n| UI Primitives | `components/ui/` | ShadCN and design system primitives |\n| Feature-specific | `components/[feature]/` | Domain-specific (bento/, etc.) |\n| Utilities | `components/` root | Small shared utilities (Icon, Logo) |\n\n## File Organization Pattern\n\nEach component directory follows this pattern:\n```\ncomponents/sections/hero/\n├── Hero.tsx        # Main component (PascalCase)\n└── index.ts        # Barrel export\n```\n\nIndex file format:\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n## ShadCN Component Rules\n\n- **NEVER modify** files in `components/ui/` directly\n- Install via: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n- Create wrappers in `components/` root for brand customization\n\n## When Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style) → `components/sections/[name]/`\n2. **Layout element** (Header, Footer, Nav) → `components/layout/[name]/`\n3. **Design primitive** (Button, Card, Input) → Use ShadCN or `components/ui/`\n4. **Small utility** (Icon, Logo) → `components/` root\n\n## Styling Rules\n\n- Always use `rounded-none` (no border radius)\n- Always include dark mode: `dark:` variants\n- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n- Follow design system in `docs/design-system.md`\n```\n\n#### 2. Create file organization rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/file-organization.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/**/*.{tsx,ts,js}\n---\n\n# File Organization Rules\n\n## Required Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/              # Next.js App Router ONLY\n├── components/       # React components\n│   ├── layout/       # Structural (Header, Footer)\n│   ├── sections/     # Page sections (Hero, FAQ)\n│   ├── ui/           # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   └── [feature]/    # Feature-specific (bento/)\n├── providers/        # React Context providers\n├── lib/              # Utilities and helpers\n├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks (when needed)\n└── types/            # TypeScript definitions (when needed)\n```\n\n## File Placement Rules\n\n| File Type | Location | Example |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Page routes | `app/[route]/page.tsx` | `app/about/page.tsx` |\n| Layouts | `app/[route]/layout.tsx` | `app/layout.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/[Name]Provider.tsx` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/[name].ts` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n| Custom hooks | `hooks/use[Name].ts` | `hooks/useAnimation.ts` |\n| Type definitions | `types/[domain].ts` | `types/api.ts` |\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n- **Components**: PascalCase (`DataVaultCard.tsx`)\n- **Utilities**: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)\n- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAnimation.ts`)\n- **Directories**: kebab-case (`flow-section/`)\n\n## Import Patterns\n\nUse barrel exports from index.ts files:\n\n```typescript\n// Good - uses barrel export\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\nimport { Hero, FAQ } from \"@/components/sections\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n\n// Avoid - direct file imports for organized components\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/header/Header\";\n```\n\n## Protected Directories\n\n- `components/ui/` - ShadCN primitives, never modify directly\n- `app/fonts/` - Font files, do not add components here\n```\n\n#### 3. Update settings.json with protection rules\n\n**File**: `.claude/settings.json`\n\nAdd to existing permissions:\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"deny\": [\n      \"Edit(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Write(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Edit(./src/components/ui/**)\",\n      \"Write(./src/components/ui/**)\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"hooks\": {\n    // ... existing hooks unchanged\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Rule files exist: `ls -la .claude/rules/`\n- [ ] Settings.json is valid JSON: `cat .claude/settings.json | jq .`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Start new Claude Code session and verify rules are loaded\n- [ ] Ask Claude to create a new section component - should go to `components/sections/`\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Update Documentation\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate CLAUDE.md and related documentation to reflect the new structure.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update CLAUDE.md Project Structure section\n\n**File**: `CLAUDE.md`\n\nReplace the Project Structure section with:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/\n│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout, fonts, providers\n│   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page (orchestrates sections)\n│   ├── globals.css     # CSS variables, base styles\n│   └── fonts/          # Local font files\n├── components/\n│   ├── layout/         # Structural components\n│   │   ├── header/     # Header component\n│   │   └── footer/     # Footer component\n│   ├── sections/       # Page content blocks\n│   │   ├── hero/\n│   │   ├── flow-section/\n│   │   ├── bento-features/\n│   │   ├── team-credentials/\n│   │   ├── faq/\n│   │   └── secondary-cta/\n│   ├── ui/             # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── bento/          # Bento grid card components\n│   ├── Icon.tsx        # Icon utility\n│   ├── Logo.tsx        # Logo component\n│   └── ThemeToggle.tsx # Theme toggle button\n├── providers/\n│   └── ThemeProvider.tsx  # Theme context\n├── lib/\n│   └── utils.ts        # cn() utility\ndocs/\n└── design-system.md    # Complete design guide\nthoughts/shared/\n├── plans/              # Implementation plans\n├── research/           # Analysis documents\n└── handoffs/           # Session handoffs\n```\n\n## File Placement Conventions\n\n| Component Type | Location | Example |\n|----------------|----------|---------|\n| Page sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | `sections/hero/Hero.tsx` |\n| Layout (Header/Footer) | `components/layout/[name]/` | `layout/header/Header.tsx` |\n| UI primitives | `components/ui/` | `ui/button.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n\n### Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/sections/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n2. **Layout component** (Header, Footer, Nav):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/layout/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n3. **ShadCN component**:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component]\n   # Creates in components/ui/ - DO NOT MODIFY\n   # Create wrapper in components/ if needed\n   ```\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md is valid markdown\n- [ ] Build still succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects new structure\n- [ ] New Claude Code sessions understand file placement\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated Tests:\n- Build succeeds without errors\n- Dev server starts correctly\n- All imports resolve\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `pnpm dev` and verify landing page renders\n2. Check all sections are visible and styled correctly\n3. Verify theme toggle works\n4. Verify Header sticky behavior\n5. Verify Footer renders at bottom\n6.

Component placement rules\n- `.claude/rules/file-organization.md` - General structure rules\n- Updated `CLAUDE.md` - Explicit file placement conventions\n- Updated `.claude/settings.json` - Protection for ui/ directory\n\n### Verification\n\nAfter implementation:\n1. All imports resolve correctly: `pnpm build`\n2. App renders without errors: `pnpm dev`\n3. TypeScript has no errors: `pnpm typecheck` (if available) or build succeeds\n4. Claude Code sessions follow placement rules when creating new files\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- NOT adding route groups `(marketing)/` (single page, not needed yet)\n- NOT adding `features/` directory (no business logic yet)\n- NOT adding `instrumentation.ts` or `proxy.ts` (no observability/auth yet)\n- NOT modifying any component logic, only moving files\n- NOT changing the ui/ or bento/ directories\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nMove files incrementally, updating imports after each move. Add Claude Code enforcement rules last to avoid conflicts during migration.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Create Directory Structure\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate the new directories and barrel export files.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create providers directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/providers\n```\n\n**File**: `src/providers/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { ThemeProvider } from \"./ThemeProvider\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Create layout directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/header\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/footer\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Header } from \"./header\";\nexport { Footer } from \"./footer\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/header/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Header } from \"./Header\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/footer/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Footer } from \"./Footer\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Create sections directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/hero\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/flow-section\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/bento-features\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/team-credentials\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/faq\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/secondary-cta\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Hero } from \"./hero\";\nexport { FlowSection } from \"./flow-section\";\nexport { BentoFeatures } from \"./bento-features\";\nexport { TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./team-credentials\";\nexport { FAQ } from \"./faq\";\nexport { SecondaryCTA } from \"./secondary-cta\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/hero/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FlowSection } from \"./FlowSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/bento-features/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as BentoFeatures } from \"./BentoFeatures\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/team-credentials/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./TeamCredentialsSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/faq/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FAQ } from \"./FAQ\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/secondary-cta/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as SecondaryCTA } from \"./SecondaryCTA\";\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] All directories created: `ls -la src/providers src/components/layout src/components/sections`\n- [x] All index.ts files exist (will have import errors until Phase 2)\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Directory structure matches plan\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Move Files and Update Imports\n\n### Overview\n\nMove component files to their new locations and update all import statements.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Move ThemeProvider to providers/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/layout.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/components/ThemeProvider\";\n\n// After\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Move Header and Footer to layout/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Header.tsx src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx\nmv src/components/Footer.tsx src/components/layout/footer/Footer.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Header from \"@/components/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/Footer\";\n\n// After\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Move section components\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Hero.tsx src/components/sections/hero/Hero.tsx\nmv src/components/FlowSection.tsx src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx\nmv src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx src/components/sections/bento-features/BentoFeatures.tsx\nmv src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx src/components/sections/team-credentials/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\nmv src/components/FAQ.tsx src/components/sections/faq/FAQ.tsx\nmv src/components/SecondaryCTA.tsx src/components/sections/secondary-cta/SecondaryCTA.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Hero from \"@/components/Hero\";\nimport TeamCredentialsSection from \"@/components/TeamCredentialsSection\";\nimport FlowSection from \"@/components/FlowSection\";\nimport BentoFeatures from \"@/components/BentoFeatures\";\nimport SecondaryCTA from \"@/components/SecondaryCTA\";\nimport FAQ from \"@/components/FAQ\";\n\n// After\nimport {\n  Hero,\n  FlowSection,\n  BentoFeatures,\n  TeamCredentialsSection,\n  FAQ,\n  SecondaryCTA,\n} from \"@/components/sections\";\n```\n\n#### 4. Update internal imports within moved files\n\nCheck each moved file for imports that reference other moved files:\n\n**Header.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- ThemeToggle (stays at root, update if needed)\n- Logo (stays at root)\n\n**BentoFeatures.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- bento/ components (path unchanged, should work)\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] Dev server starts: `pnpm dev`\n- [ ] No import errors in terminal\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Landing page renders correctly at http://localhost:3000\n- [ ] All sections visible (Hero, Flow, Features, FAQ, etc.)\n- [ ] Header and Footer render\n- [ ] Theme toggle works\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation that the site renders correctly before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add Claude Code Enforcement Rules\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate `.claude/rules/` files to enforce folder structure in future Claude Code sessions.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create components rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/components.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/components/**/*.{tsx,ts}\n---\n\n# Component Development Rules\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nComponents must be placed in the correct directory based on their type:\n\n| Type | Location | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Layout | `components/layout/[name]/` | Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav |\n| Sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | Page content blocks (Hero, FAQ, CTA) |\n| UI Primitives | `components/ui/` | ShadCN and design system primitives |\n| Feature-specific | `components/[feature]/` | Domain-specific (bento/, etc.) |\n| Utilities | `components/` root | Small shared utilities (Icon, Logo) |\n\n## File Organization Pattern\n\nEach component directory follows this pattern:\n```\ncomponents/sections/hero/\n├── Hero.tsx        # Main component (PascalCase)\n└── index.ts        # Barrel export\n```\n\nIndex file format:\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n## ShadCN Component Rules\n\n- **NEVER modify** files in `components/ui/` directly\n- Install via: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n- Create wrappers in `components/` root for brand customization\n\n## When Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style) → `components/sections/[name]/`\n2. **Layout element** (Header, Footer, Nav) → `components/layout/[name]/`\n3. **Design primitive** (Button, Card, Input) → Use ShadCN or `components/ui/`\n4. **Small utility** (Icon, Logo) → `components/` root\n\n## Styling Rules\n\n- Always use `rounded-none` (no border radius)\n- Always include dark mode: `dark:` variants\n- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n- Follow design system in `docs/design-system.md`\n```\n\n#### 2. Create file organization rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/file-organization.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/**/*.{tsx,ts,js}\n---\n\n# File Organization Rules\n\n## Required Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/              # Next.js App Router ONLY\n├── components/       # React components\n│   ├── layout/       # Structural (Header, Footer)\n│   ├── sections/     # Page sections (Hero, FAQ)\n│   ├── ui/           # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   └── [feature]/    # Feature-specific (bento/)\n├── providers/        # React Context providers\n├── lib/              # Utilities and helpers\n├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks (when needed)\n└── types/            # TypeScript definitions (when needed)\n```\n\n## File Placement Rules\n\n| File Type | Location | Example |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Page routes | `app/[route]/page.tsx` | `app/about/page.tsx` |\n| Layouts | `app/[route]/layout.tsx` | `app/layout.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/[Name]Provider.tsx` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/[name].ts` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n| Custom hooks | `hooks/use[Name].ts` | `hooks/useAnimation.ts` |\n| Type definitions | `types/[domain].ts` | `types/api.ts` |\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n- **Components**: PascalCase (`DataVaultCard.tsx`)\n- **Utilities**: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)\n- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAnimation.ts`)\n- **Directories**: kebab-case (`flow-section/`)\n\n## Import Patterns\n\nUse barrel exports from index.ts files:\n\n```typescript\n// Good - uses barrel export\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\nimport { Hero, FAQ } from \"@/components/sections\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n\n// Avoid - direct file imports for organized components\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/header/Header\";\n```\n\n## Protected Directories\n\n- `components/ui/` - ShadCN primitives, never modify directly\n- `app/fonts/` - Font files, do not add components here\n```\n\n#### 3. Update settings.json with protection rules\n\n**File**: `.claude/settings.json`\n\nAdd to existing permissions:\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"deny\": [\n      \"Edit(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Write(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Edit(./src/components/ui/**)\",\n      \"Write(./src/components/ui/**)\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"hooks\": {\n    // ... existing hooks unchanged\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Rule files exist: `ls -la .claude/rules/`\n- [ ] Settings.json is valid JSON: `cat .claude/settings.json | jq .`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Start new Claude Code session and verify rules are loaded\n- [ ] Ask Claude to create a new section component - should go to `components/sections/`\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Update Documentation\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate CLAUDE.md and related documentation to reflect the new structure.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update CLAUDE.md Project Structure section\n\n**File**: `CLAUDE.md`\n\nReplace the Project Structure section with:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/\n│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout, fonts, providers\n│   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page (orchestrates sections)\n│   ├── globals.css     # CSS variables, base styles\n│   └── fonts/          # Local font files\n├── components/\n│   ├── layout/         # Structural components\n│   │   ├── header/     # Header component\n│   │   └── footer/     # Footer component\n│   ├── sections/       # Page content blocks\n│   │   ├── hero/\n│   │   ├── flow-section/\n│   │   ├── bento-features/\n│   │   ├── team-credentials/\n│   │   ├── faq/\n│   │   └── secondary-cta/\n│   ├── ui/             # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── bento/          # Bento grid card components\n│   ├── Icon.tsx        # Icon utility\n│   ├── Logo.tsx        # Logo component\n│   └── ThemeToggle.tsx # Theme toggle button\n├── providers/\n│   └── ThemeProvider.tsx  # Theme context\n├── lib/\n│   └── utils.ts        # cn() utility\ndocs/\n└── design-system.md    # Complete design guide\nthoughts/shared/\n├── plans/              # Implementation plans\n├── research/           # Analysis documents\n└── handoffs/           # Session handoffs\n```\n\n## File Placement Conventions\n\n| Component Type | Location | Example |\n|----------------|----------|---------|\n| Page sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | `sections/hero/Hero.tsx` |\n| Layout (Header/Footer) | `components/layout/[name]/` | `layout/header/Header.tsx` |\n| UI primitives | `components/ui/` | `ui/button.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n\n### Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/sections/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n2. **Layout component** (Header, Footer, Nav):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/layout/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n3. **ShadCN component**:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component]\n   # Creates in components/ui/ - DO NOT MODIFY\n   # Create wrapper in components/ if needed\n   ```\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md is valid markdown\n- [ ] Build still succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects new structure\n- [ ] New Claude Code sessions understand file placement\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated Tests:\n- Build succeeds without errors\n- Dev server starts correctly\n- All imports resolve\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `pnpm dev` and verify landing page renders\n2. Check all sections are visible and styled correctly\n3. Verify theme toggle works\n4. Verify Header sticky behavior\n5. Verify Footer renders at bottom\n6.

All imports resolve correctly: `pnpm build`\n2. App renders without errors: `pnpm dev`\n3. TypeScript has no errors: `pnpm typecheck` (if available) or build succeeds\n4. Claude Code sessions follow placement rules when creating new files\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- NOT adding route groups `(marketing)/` (single page, not needed yet)\n- NOT adding `features/` directory (no business logic yet)\n- NOT adding `instrumentation.ts` or `proxy.ts` (no observability/auth yet)\n- NOT modifying any component logic, only moving files\n- NOT changing the ui/ or bento/ directories\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nMove files incrementally, updating imports after each move. Add Claude Code enforcement rules last to avoid conflicts during migration.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Create Directory Structure\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate the new directories and barrel export files.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create providers directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/providers\n```\n\n**File**: `src/providers/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { ThemeProvider } from \"./ThemeProvider\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Create layout directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/header\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/footer\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Header } from \"./header\";\nexport { Footer } from \"./footer\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/header/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Header } from \"./Header\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/footer/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Footer } from \"./Footer\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Create sections directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/hero\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/flow-section\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/bento-features\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/team-credentials\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/faq\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/secondary-cta\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Hero } from \"./hero\";\nexport { FlowSection } from \"./flow-section\";\nexport { BentoFeatures } from \"./bento-features\";\nexport { TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./team-credentials\";\nexport { FAQ } from \"./faq\";\nexport { SecondaryCTA } from \"./secondary-cta\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/hero/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FlowSection } from \"./FlowSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/bento-features/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as BentoFeatures } from \"./BentoFeatures\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/team-credentials/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./TeamCredentialsSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/faq/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FAQ } from \"./FAQ\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/secondary-cta/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as SecondaryCTA } from \"./SecondaryCTA\";\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] All directories created: `ls -la src/providers src/components/layout src/components/sections`\n- [x] All index.ts files exist (will have import errors until Phase 2)\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Directory structure matches plan\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Move Files and Update Imports\n\n### Overview\n\nMove component files to their new locations and update all import statements.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Move ThemeProvider to providers/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/layout.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/components/ThemeProvider\";\n\n// After\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Move Header and Footer to layout/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Header.tsx src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx\nmv src/components/Footer.tsx src/components/layout/footer/Footer.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Header from \"@/components/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/Footer\";\n\n// After\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Move section components\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Hero.tsx src/components/sections/hero/Hero.tsx\nmv src/components/FlowSection.tsx src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx\nmv src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx src/components/sections/bento-features/BentoFeatures.tsx\nmv src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx src/components/sections/team-credentials/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\nmv src/components/FAQ.tsx src/components/sections/faq/FAQ.tsx\nmv src/components/SecondaryCTA.tsx src/components/sections/secondary-cta/SecondaryCTA.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Hero from \"@/components/Hero\";\nimport TeamCredentialsSection from \"@/components/TeamCredentialsSection\";\nimport FlowSection from \"@/components/FlowSection\";\nimport BentoFeatures from \"@/components/BentoFeatures\";\nimport SecondaryCTA from \"@/components/SecondaryCTA\";\nimport FAQ from \"@/components/FAQ\";\n\n// After\nimport {\n  Hero,\n  FlowSection,\n  BentoFeatures,\n  TeamCredentialsSection,\n  FAQ,\n  SecondaryCTA,\n} from \"@/components/sections\";\n```\n\n#### 4. Update internal imports within moved files\n\nCheck each moved file for imports that reference other moved files:\n\n**Header.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- ThemeToggle (stays at root, update if needed)\n- Logo (stays at root)\n\n**BentoFeatures.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- bento/ components (path unchanged, should work)\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] Dev server starts: `pnpm dev`\n- [ ] No import errors in terminal\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Landing page renders correctly at http://localhost:3000\n- [ ] All sections visible (Hero, Flow, Features, FAQ, etc.)\n- [ ] Header and Footer render\n- [ ] Theme toggle works\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation that the site renders correctly before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add Claude Code Enforcement Rules\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate `.claude/rules/` files to enforce folder structure in future Claude Code sessions.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create components rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/components.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/components/**/*.{tsx,ts}\n---\n\n# Component Development Rules\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nComponents must be placed in the correct directory based on their type:\n\n| Type | Location | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Layout | `components/layout/[name]/` | Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav |\n| Sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | Page content blocks (Hero, FAQ, CTA) |\n| UI Primitives | `components/ui/` | ShadCN and design system primitives |\n| Feature-specific | `components/[feature]/` | Domain-specific (bento/, etc.) |\n| Utilities | `components/` root | Small shared utilities (Icon, Logo) |\n\n## File Organization Pattern\n\nEach component directory follows this pattern:\n```\ncomponents/sections/hero/\n├── Hero.tsx        # Main component (PascalCase)\n└── index.ts        # Barrel export\n```\n\nIndex file format:\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n## ShadCN Component Rules\n\n- **NEVER modify** files in `components/ui/` directly\n- Install via: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n- Create wrappers in `components/` root for brand customization\n\n## When Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style) → `components/sections/[name]/`\n2. **Layout element** (Header, Footer, Nav) → `components/layout/[name]/`\n3. **Design primitive** (Button, Card, Input) → Use ShadCN or `components/ui/`\n4. **Small utility** (Icon, Logo) → `components/` root\n\n## Styling Rules\n\n- Always use `rounded-none` (no border radius)\n- Always include dark mode: `dark:` variants\n- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n- Follow design system in `docs/design-system.md`\n```\n\n#### 2. Create file organization rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/file-organization.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/**/*.{tsx,ts,js}\n---\n\n# File Organization Rules\n\n## Required Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/              # Next.js App Router ONLY\n├── components/       # React components\n│   ├── layout/       # Structural (Header, Footer)\n│   ├── sections/     # Page sections (Hero, FAQ)\n│   ├── ui/           # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   └── [feature]/    # Feature-specific (bento/)\n├── providers/        # React Context providers\n├── lib/              # Utilities and helpers\n├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks (when needed)\n└── types/            # TypeScript definitions (when needed)\n```\n\n## File Placement Rules\n\n| File Type | Location | Example |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Page routes | `app/[route]/page.tsx` | `app/about/page.tsx` |\n| Layouts | `app/[route]/layout.tsx` | `app/layout.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/[Name]Provider.tsx` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/[name].ts` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n| Custom hooks | `hooks/use[Name].ts` | `hooks/useAnimation.ts` |\n| Type definitions | `types/[domain].ts` | `types/api.ts` |\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n- **Components**: PascalCase (`DataVaultCard.tsx`)\n- **Utilities**: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)\n- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAnimation.ts`)\n- **Directories**: kebab-case (`flow-section/`)\n\n## Import Patterns\n\nUse barrel exports from index.ts files:\n\n```typescript\n// Good - uses barrel export\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\nimport { Hero, FAQ } from \"@/components/sections\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n\n// Avoid - direct file imports for organized components\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/header/Header\";\n```\n\n## Protected Directories\n\n- `components/ui/` - ShadCN primitives, never modify directly\n- `app/fonts/` - Font files, do not add components here\n```\n\n#### 3. Update settings.json with protection rules\n\n**File**: `.claude/settings.json`\n\nAdd to existing permissions:\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"deny\": [\n      \"Edit(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Write(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Edit(./src/components/ui/**)\",\n      \"Write(./src/components/ui/**)\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"hooks\": {\n    // ... existing hooks unchanged\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Rule files exist: `ls -la .claude/rules/`\n- [ ] Settings.json is valid JSON: `cat .claude/settings.json | jq .`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Start new Claude Code session and verify rules are loaded\n- [ ] Ask Claude to create a new section component - should go to `components/sections/`\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Update Documentation\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate CLAUDE.md and related documentation to reflect the new structure.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update CLAUDE.md Project Structure section\n\n**File**: `CLAUDE.md`\n\nReplace the Project Structure section with:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/\n│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout, fonts, providers\n│   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page (orchestrates sections)\n│   ├── globals.css     # CSS variables, base styles\n│   └── fonts/          # Local font files\n├── components/\n│   ├── layout/         # Structural components\n│   │   ├── header/     # Header component\n│   │   └── footer/     # Footer component\n│   ├── sections/       # Page content blocks\n│   │   ├── hero/\n│   │   ├── flow-section/\n│   │   ├── bento-features/\n│   │   ├── team-credentials/\n│   │   ├── faq/\n│   │   └── secondary-cta/\n│   ├── ui/             # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── bento/          # Bento grid card components\n│   ├── Icon.tsx        # Icon utility\n│   ├── Logo.tsx        # Logo component\n│   └── ThemeToggle.tsx # Theme toggle button\n├── providers/\n│   └── ThemeProvider.tsx  # Theme context\n├── lib/\n│   └── utils.ts        # cn() utility\ndocs/\n└── design-system.md    # Complete design guide\nthoughts/shared/\n├── plans/              # Implementation plans\n├── research/           # Analysis documents\n└── handoffs/           # Session handoffs\n```\n\n## File Placement Conventions\n\n| Component Type | Location | Example |\n|----------------|----------|---------|\n| Page sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | `sections/hero/Hero.tsx` |\n| Layout (Header/Footer) | `components/layout/[name]/` | `layout/header/Header.tsx` |\n| UI primitives | `components/ui/` | `ui/button.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n\n### Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/sections/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n2. **Layout component** (Header, Footer, Nav):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/layout/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n3. **ShadCN component**:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component]\n   # Creates in components/ui/ - DO NOT MODIFY\n   # Create wrapper in components/ if needed\n   ```\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md is valid markdown\n- [ ] Build still succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects new structure\n- [ ] New Claude Code sessions understand file placement\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated Tests:\n- Build succeeds without errors\n- Dev server starts correctly\n- All imports resolve\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `pnpm dev` and verify landing page renders\n2. Check all sections are visible and styled correctly\n3. Verify theme toggle works\n4. Verify Header sticky behavior\n5. Verify Footer renders at bottom\n6. Start new Claude Code session and ask it to create a component\n\n## References\n\n- Research document: `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-26-nextjs-folder-structure-comparison.md`\n- NextJS 16 folder structure guidelines (provided by user)\n- Claude Code documentation for rules and settings\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":472,"oldLines":8,"newStart":472,"newLines":8,"lines":[" ### Success Criteria:"," "," #### Automated Verification:","-- [ ] Rule files exist: `ls -la .claude/rules/`","-- [ ] Settings.json is valid JSON: `cat .claude/settings.json | jq .`","+- [x] Rule files exist: `ls -la .claude/rules/`","+- [x] Settings.json is valid JSON: `cat .claude/settings.json | jq .`"," "," #### Manual Verification:"," - [ ] Start new Claude Code session and verify rules are loaded"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Without touching your task list.\"\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n| Category | Technology | Notes |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| Framework | Next.js 16 | App Router |\n| UI | React 19 | RSC support |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 | With postcss |\n| Animation | Framer Motion | Header, pulse effects |\n| Icons | Iconify | Lucide + Simple Icons |\n| Fonts | Switzer + Geist Mono | Local + Google |\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/\n│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout, fonts, providers\n│   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page (orchestrates sections)\n│   └── globals.css     # CSS variables, base styles\n├── components/\n│   ├── Header.tsx      # Sticky nav, theme toggle\n│   ├── Hero.tsx        # Headline + CTA\n│   ├── TeamCredentialsSection.tsx  # Logo carousel\n│   ├── FlowSection.tsx # AI processing diagram\n│   ├── BentoFeatures.tsx  # Feature cards grid\n│   ├── FAQ.tsx         # Accordion Q&A\n│   ├── SecondaryCTA.tsx\n│   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   ├── ui/             # Primitives (Button, PlusCornerCard, etc.)\n│   └── bento/          # Bento grid card components\n├── lib/\n│   └── utils.ts        # cn() utility\ndocs/\n└── design-system.md    # Complete design guide (v6.0)\nthoughts/shared/\n├── plans/              # Implementation plans\n├── research/           # Analysis documents\n└── handoffs/           # Session handoffs\n```\n\n## Design System\n\nSee [`docs/design-system.md`](docs/design-system.md) for complete guidelines.\n\n**Identity**: Technical Blueprint — engineering-drawing aesthetic with sharp corners and precision.\n\n**Signature element**: Plus Corners (4 plus signs marking featured container corners)\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n| Element | Pattern |\n|---------|---------|\n| Primary text | `text-black dark:text-white` |\n| Muted text | `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` |\n| Borders | `border-black dark:border-white` or `border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700` |\n| Container | `max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 md:px-12` |\n| Section padding | `py-16 md:py-24` |\n| Border radius | Always 0 (`rounded-none`) |\n\n### Accent Colors\n\n| Color | Hex | Use |\n|-------|-----|-----|\n| Emerald | #10B981 | Success, AI actions |\n| Violet | #8B5CF6 | Categories, tags |\n| Amber | #F59E0B | Warnings |\n| Rose | #F43F5E | Errors |\n| Sky | #0EA5E9 | Info, links |\n\n## Component Patterns\n\n### Button Variants\n\nCustom Button component at `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`:\n\n- **primary**: White bg, black text/border (default)\n- **solid**: Black bg, white text\n- **secondary**: Transparent bg, black text/border\n- **ghost**: No border, subtle hover\n\n### Animation\n\n- **UI animations**: Fast (100-150ms) — hover states, transitions\n- **Ambient animations**: Slow (2-25s) — logo pulse, carousels\n- Always respect `useReducedMotion()`\n\n### Dark Mode\n\nAlways pair light/dark variants:\n```tsx\nclassName=\"bg-white dark:bg-black text-black dark:text-white\"\n```\n\n## ShadCN UI (When Adding Components)\n\n1. Install: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n2. Components install to `src/components/ui/`\n3. **Never modify ShadCN files directly**\n4. Create wrapper components for brand customization\n\nExample wrapper:\n```tsx\n// src/components/Card.tsx\nimport { Card as ShadcnCard } from \"@/components/ui/card\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\nexport function Card({ className, ...props }) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnCard\n      className={cn(\"rounded-none border-black dark:border-white\", className)}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Code Style\n\n- TypeScript for all components\n- React 19: No `forwardRef` needed, ref is a regular prop\n- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n- Use `ComponentProps<typeof X>` for type inference\n- Destructure props with defaults\n\n## Current Work\n\nBranch: `feat/design-system`\n\nLanding page redesign in progress. See `thoughts/shared/plans/` for implementation details.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":26,"oldLines":28,"newStart":26,"newLines":67,"lines":[" ├── app/"," │   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout, fonts, providers"," │   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page (orchestrates sections)","-│   └── globals.css     # CSS variables, base styles","+│   ├── globals.css     # CSS variables, base styles","+│   └── fonts/          # Local font files"," ├── components/","-│   ├── Header.tsx      # Sticky nav, theme toggle","-│   ├── Hero.tsx        # Headline + CTA","-│   ├── TeamCredentialsSection.tsx  # Logo carousel","-│   ├── FlowSection.tsx # AI processing diagram","-│   ├── BentoFeatures.tsx  # Feature cards grid","-│   ├── FAQ.tsx         # Accordion Q&A","-│   ├── SecondaryCTA.tsx","-│   ├── Footer.tsx","-│   ├── ui/             # Primitives (Button, PlusCornerCard, etc.)","-│   └── bento/          # Bento grid card components","+│   ├── layout/         # Structural components","+│   │   ├── header/     # Header component","+│   │   └── footer/     # Footer component","+│   ├── sections/       # Page content blocks","+│   │   ├── hero/","+│   │   ├── flow-section/","+│   │   ├── bento-features/","+│   │   ├── team-credentials/","+│   │   ├── faq/","+│   │   └── secondary-cta/","+│   ├── ui/             # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)","+│   ├── bento/          # Bento grid card components","+│   ├── Icon.tsx        # Icon utility","+│   ├── Logo.tsx        # Logo component","+│   └── ThemeToggle.tsx # Theme toggle button","+├── providers/","+│   └── ThemeProvider.tsx  # Theme context"," ├── lib/"," │   └── utils.ts        # cn() utility"," docs/","-└── design-system.md    # Complete design guide (v6.0)","+└── design-system.md    # Complete design guide"," thoughts/shared/"," ├── plans/              # Implementation plans"," ├── research/           # Analysis documents"," └── handoffs/           # Session handoffs"," ```"," ","+## File Placement Conventions","+","+| Component Type | Location | Example |","+|----------------|----------|---------|","+| Page sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | `sections/hero/Hero.tsx` |","+| Layout (Header/Footer) | `components/layout/[name]/` | `layout/header/Header.tsx` |","+| UI primitives | `components/ui/` | `ui/button.tsx` |","+| Context providers | `providers/` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |","+| Utilities | `lib/` | `lib/utils.ts` |","+","+### Creating New Components","+","+1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style):","+   ```bash","+   mkdir src/components/sections/[name]","+   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts","+   ```","+","+2. **Layout component** (Header, Footer, Nav):","+   ```bash","+   mkdir src/components/layout/[name]","+   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts","+   ```","+","+3. **ShadCN component**:","+   ```bash","+   pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component]","+   # Creates in components/ui/ - DO NOT MODIFY","+   # Create wrapper in components/ if needed","+   ```","+"," ## Design System"," "," See [`docs/design-system.md`](docs/design-system.md) for complete guidelines."]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

All imports resolve correctly: `pnpm build`\n2. App renders without errors: `pnpm dev`\n3. TypeScript has no errors: `pnpm typecheck` (if available) or build succeeds\n4. Claude Code sessions follow placement rules when creating new files\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- NOT adding route groups `(marketing)/` (single page, not needed yet)\n- NOT adding `features/` directory (no business logic yet)\n- NOT adding `instrumentation.ts` or `proxy.ts` (no observability/auth yet)\n- NOT modifying any component logic, only moving files\n- NOT changing the ui/ or bento/ directories\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nMove files incrementally, updating imports after each move. Add Claude Code enforcement rules last to avoid conflicts during migration.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Create Directory Structure\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate the new directories and barrel export files.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create providers directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/providers\n```\n\n**File**: `src/providers/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { ThemeProvider } from \"./ThemeProvider\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Create layout directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/header\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/footer\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Header } from \"./header\";\nexport { Footer } from \"./footer\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/header/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Header } from \"./Header\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/footer/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Footer } from \"./Footer\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Create sections directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/hero\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/flow-section\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/bento-features\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/team-credentials\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/faq\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/secondary-cta\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Hero } from \"./hero\";\nexport { FlowSection } from \"./flow-section\";\nexport { BentoFeatures } from \"./bento-features\";\nexport { TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./team-credentials\";\nexport { FAQ } from \"./faq\";\nexport { SecondaryCTA } from \"./secondary-cta\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/hero/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FlowSection } from \"./FlowSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/bento-features/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as BentoFeatures } from \"./BentoFeatures\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/team-credentials/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./TeamCredentialsSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/faq/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FAQ } from \"./FAQ\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/secondary-cta/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as SecondaryCTA } from \"./SecondaryCTA\";\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] All directories created: `ls -la src/providers src/components/layout src/components/sections`\n- [x] All index.ts files exist (will have import errors until Phase 2)\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Directory structure matches plan\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Move Files and Update Imports\n\n### Overview\n\nMove component files to their new locations and update all import statements.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Move ThemeProvider to providers/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/layout.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/components/ThemeProvider\";\n\n// After\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Move Header and Footer to layout/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Header.tsx src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx\nmv src/components/Footer.tsx src/components/layout/footer/Footer.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Header from \"@/components/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/Footer\";\n\n// After\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Move section components\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Hero.tsx src/components/sections/hero/Hero.tsx\nmv src/components/FlowSection.tsx src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx\nmv src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx src/components/sections/bento-features/BentoFeatures.tsx\nmv src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx src/components/sections/team-credentials/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\nmv src/components/FAQ.tsx src/components/sections/faq/FAQ.tsx\nmv src/components/SecondaryCTA.tsx src/components/sections/secondary-cta/SecondaryCTA.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Hero from \"@/components/Hero\";\nimport TeamCredentialsSection from \"@/components/TeamCredentialsSection\";\nimport FlowSection from \"@/components/FlowSection\";\nimport BentoFeatures from \"@/components/BentoFeatures\";\nimport SecondaryCTA from \"@/components/SecondaryCTA\";\nimport FAQ from \"@/components/FAQ\";\n\n// After\nimport {\n  Hero,\n  FlowSection,\n  BentoFeatures,\n  TeamCredentialsSection,\n  FAQ,\n  SecondaryCTA,\n} from \"@/components/sections\";\n```\n\n#### 4. Update internal imports within moved files\n\nCheck each moved file for imports that reference other moved files:\n\n**Header.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- ThemeToggle (stays at root, update if needed)\n- Logo (stays at root)\n\n**BentoFeatures.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- bento/ components (path unchanged, should work)\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] Dev server starts: `pnpm dev`\n- [ ] No import errors in terminal\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Landing page renders correctly at http://localhost:3000\n- [ ] All sections visible (Hero, Flow, Features, FAQ, etc.)\n- [ ] Header and Footer render\n- [ ] Theme toggle works\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation that the site renders correctly before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add Claude Code Enforcement Rules\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate `.claude/rules/` files to enforce folder structure in future Claude Code sessions.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create components rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/components.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/components/**/*.{tsx,ts}\n---\n\n# Component Development Rules\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nComponents must be placed in the correct directory based on their type:\n\n| Type | Location | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Layout | `components/layout/[name]/` | Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav |\n| Sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | Page content blocks (Hero, FAQ, CTA) |\n| UI Primitives | `components/ui/` | ShadCN and design system primitives |\n| Feature-specific | `components/[feature]/` | Domain-specific (bento/, etc.) |\n| Utilities | `components/` root | Small shared utilities (Icon, Logo) |\n\n## File Organization Pattern\n\nEach component directory follows this pattern:\n```\ncomponents/sections/hero/\n├── Hero.tsx        # Main component (PascalCase)\n└── index.ts        # Barrel export\n```\n\nIndex file format:\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n## ShadCN Component Rules\n\n- **NEVER modify** files in `components/ui/` directly\n- Install via: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n- Create wrappers in `components/` root for brand customization\n\n## When Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style) → `components/sections/[name]/`\n2. **Layout element** (Header, Footer, Nav) → `components/layout/[name]/`\n3. **Design primitive** (Button, Card, Input) → Use ShadCN or `components/ui/`\n4. **Small utility** (Icon, Logo) → `components/` root\n\n## Styling Rules\n\n- Always use `rounded-none` (no border radius)\n- Always include dark mode: `dark:` variants\n- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n- Follow design system in `docs/design-system.md`\n```\n\n#### 2. Create file organization rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/file-organization.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/**/*.{tsx,ts,js}\n---\n\n# File Organization Rules\n\n## Required Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/              # Next.js App Router ONLY\n├── components/       # React components\n│   ├── layout/       # Structural (Header, Footer)\n│   ├── sections/     # Page sections (Hero, FAQ)\n│   ├── ui/           # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   └── [feature]/    # Feature-specific (bento/)\n├── providers/        # React Context providers\n├── lib/              # Utilities and helpers\n├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks (when needed)\n└── types/            # TypeScript definitions (when needed)\n```\n\n## File Placement Rules\n\n| File Type | Location | Example |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Page routes | `app/[route]/page.tsx` | `app/about/page.tsx` |\n| Layouts | `app/[route]/layout.tsx` | `app/layout.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/[Name]Provider.tsx` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/[name].ts` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n| Custom hooks | `hooks/use[Name].ts` | `hooks/useAnimation.ts` |\n| Type definitions | `types/[domain].ts` | `types/api.ts` |\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n- **Components**: PascalCase (`DataVaultCard.tsx`)\n- **Utilities**: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)\n- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAnimation.ts`)\n- **Directories**: kebab-case (`flow-section/`)\n\n## Import Patterns\n\nUse barrel exports from index.ts files:\n\n```typescript\n// Good - uses barrel export\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\nimport { Hero, FAQ } from \"@/components/sections\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n\n// Avoid - direct file imports for organized components\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/header/Header\";\n```\n\n## Protected Directories\n\n- `components/ui/` - ShadCN primitives, never modify directly\n- `app/fonts/` - Font files, do not add components here\n```\n\n#### 3. Update settings.json with protection rules\n\n**File**: `.claude/settings.json`\n\nAdd to existing permissions:\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"deny\": [\n      \"Edit(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Write(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Edit(./src/components/ui/**)\",\n      \"Write(./src/components/ui/**)\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"hooks\": {\n    // ... existing hooks unchanged\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Rule files exist: `ls -la .claude/rules/`\n- [x] Settings.json is valid JSON: `cat .claude/settings.json | jq .`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Start new Claude Code session and verify rules are loaded\n- [ ] Ask Claude to create a new section component - should go to `components/sections/`\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Update Documentation\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate CLAUDE.md and related documentation to reflect the new structure.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update CLAUDE.md Project Structure section\n\n**File**: `CLAUDE.md`\n\nReplace the Project Structure section with:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/\n│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout, fonts, providers\n│   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page (orchestrates sections)\n│   ├── globals.css     # CSS variables, base styles\n│   └── fonts/          # Local font files\n├── components/\n│   ├── layout/         # Structural components\n│   │   ├── header/     # Header component\n│   │   └── footer/     # Footer component\n│   ├── sections/       # Page content blocks\n│   │   ├── hero/\n│   │   ├── flow-section/\n│   │   ├── bento-features/\n│   │   ├── team-credentials/\n│   │   ├── faq/\n│   │   └── secondary-cta/\n│   ├── ui/             # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── bento/          # Bento grid card components\n│   ├── Icon.tsx        # Icon utility\n│   ├── Logo.tsx        # Logo component\n│   └── ThemeToggle.tsx # Theme toggle button\n├── providers/\n│   └── ThemeProvider.tsx  # Theme context\n├── lib/\n│   └── utils.ts        # cn() utility\ndocs/\n└── design-system.md    # Complete design guide\nthoughts/shared/\n├── plans/              # Implementation plans\n├── research/           # Analysis documents\n└── handoffs/           # Session handoffs\n```\n\n## File Placement Conventions\n\n| Component Type | Location | Example |\n|----------------|----------|---------|\n| Page sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | `sections/hero/Hero.tsx` |\n| Layout (Header/Footer) | `components/layout/[name]/` | `layout/header/Header.tsx` |\n| UI primitives | `components/ui/` | `ui/button.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n\n### Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/sections/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n2. **Layout component** (Header, Footer, Nav):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/layout/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n3. **ShadCN component**:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component]\n   # Creates in components/ui/ - DO NOT MODIFY\n   # Create wrapper in components/ if needed\n   ```\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md is valid markdown\n- [ ] Build still succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects new structure\n- [ ] New Claude Code sessions understand file placement\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated Tests:\n- Build succeeds without errors\n- Dev server starts correctly\n- All imports resolve\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `pnpm dev` and verify landing page renders\n2. Check all sections are visible and styled correctly\n3. Verify theme toggle works\n4. Verify Header sticky behavior\n5.

All imports resolve correctly: `pnpm build`\n2. App renders without errors: `pnpm dev`\n3. TypeScript has no errors: `pnpm typecheck` (if available) or build succeeds\n4. Claude Code sessions follow placement rules when creating new files\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- NOT adding route groups `(marketing)/` (single page, not needed yet)\n- NOT adding `features/` directory (no business logic yet)\n- NOT adding `instrumentation.ts` or `proxy.ts` (no observability/auth yet)\n- NOT modifying any component logic, only moving files\n- NOT changing the ui/ or bento/ directories\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nMove files incrementally, updating imports after each move. Add Claude Code enforcement rules last to avoid conflicts during migration.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Create Directory Structure\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate the new directories and barrel export files.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create providers directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/providers\n```\n\n**File**: `src/providers/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { ThemeProvider } from \"./ThemeProvider\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Create layout directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/header\nmkdir -p src/components/layout/footer\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Header } from \"./header\";\nexport { Footer } from \"./footer\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/header/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Header } from \"./Header\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/layout/footer/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Footer } from \"./Footer\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Create sections directory structure\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/hero\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/flow-section\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/bento-features\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/team-credentials\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/faq\nmkdir -p src/components/sections/secondary-cta\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { Hero } from \"./hero\";\nexport { FlowSection } from \"./flow-section\";\nexport { BentoFeatures } from \"./bento-features\";\nexport { TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./team-credentials\";\nexport { FAQ } from \"./faq\";\nexport { SecondaryCTA } from \"./secondary-cta\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/hero/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/flow-section/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FlowSection } from \"./FlowSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/bento-features/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as BentoFeatures } from \"./BentoFeatures\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/team-credentials/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as TeamCredentialsSection } from \"./TeamCredentialsSection\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/faq/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as FAQ } from \"./FAQ\";\n```\n\n**File**: `src/components/sections/secondary-cta/index.ts`\n```typescript\nexport { default as SecondaryCTA } from \"./SecondaryCTA\";\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] All directories created: `ls -la src/providers src/components/layout src/components/sections`\n- [x] All index.ts files exist (will have import errors until Phase 2)\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Directory structure matches plan\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Move Files and Update Imports\n\n### Overview\n\nMove component files to their new locations and update all import statements.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Move ThemeProvider to providers/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/layout.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/components/ThemeProvider\";\n\n// After\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n```\n\n#### 2. Move Header and Footer to layout/\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Header.tsx src/components/layout/header/Header.tsx\nmv src/components/Footer.tsx src/components/layout/footer/Footer.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Header from \"@/components/Header\";\nimport Footer from \"@/components/Footer\";\n\n// After\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\n```\n\n#### 3. Move section components\n\n```bash\nmv src/components/Hero.tsx src/components/sections/hero/Hero.tsx\nmv src/components/FlowSection.tsx src/components/sections/flow-section/FlowSection.tsx\nmv src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx src/components/sections/bento-features/BentoFeatures.tsx\nmv src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx src/components/sections/team-credentials/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx\nmv src/components/FAQ.tsx src/components/sections/faq/FAQ.tsx\nmv src/components/SecondaryCTA.tsx src/components/sections/secondary-cta/SecondaryCTA.tsx\n```\n\n**Update imports in**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport Hero from \"@/components/Hero\";\nimport TeamCredentialsSection from \"@/components/TeamCredentialsSection\";\nimport FlowSection from \"@/components/FlowSection\";\nimport BentoFeatures from \"@/components/BentoFeatures\";\nimport SecondaryCTA from \"@/components/SecondaryCTA\";\nimport FAQ from \"@/components/FAQ\";\n\n// After\nimport {\n  Hero,\n  FlowSection,\n  BentoFeatures,\n  TeamCredentialsSection,\n  FAQ,\n  SecondaryCTA,\n} from \"@/components/sections\";\n```\n\n#### 4. Update internal imports within moved files\n\nCheck each moved file for imports that reference other moved files:\n\n**Header.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- ThemeToggle (stays at root, update if needed)\n- Logo (stays at root)\n\n**BentoFeatures.tsx** - Check for imports of:\n- bento/ components (path unchanged, should work)\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] Dev server starts: `pnpm dev`\n- [ ] No import errors in terminal\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Landing page renders correctly at http://localhost:3000\n- [ ] All sections visible (Hero, Flow, Features, FAQ, etc.)\n- [ ] Header and Footer render\n- [ ] Theme toggle works\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation that the site renders correctly before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add Claude Code Enforcement Rules\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate `.claude/rules/` files to enforce folder structure in future Claude Code sessions.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create components rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/components.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/components/**/*.{tsx,ts}\n---\n\n# Component Development Rules\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nComponents must be placed in the correct directory based on their type:\n\n| Type | Location | Description |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| Layout | `components/layout/[name]/` | Header, Footer, Sidebar, Nav |\n| Sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | Page content blocks (Hero, FAQ, CTA) |\n| UI Primitives | `components/ui/` | ShadCN and design system primitives |\n| Feature-specific | `components/[feature]/` | Domain-specific (bento/, etc.) |\n| Utilities | `components/` root | Small shared utilities (Icon, Logo) |\n\n## File Organization Pattern\n\nEach component directory follows this pattern:\n```\ncomponents/sections/hero/\n├── Hero.tsx        # Main component (PascalCase)\n└── index.ts        # Barrel export\n```\n\nIndex file format:\n```typescript\nexport { default as Hero } from \"./Hero\";\n```\n\n## ShadCN Component Rules\n\n- **NEVER modify** files in `components/ui/` directly\n- Install via: `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add <component>`\n- Create wrappers in `components/` root for brand customization\n\n## When Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style) → `components/sections/[name]/`\n2. **Layout element** (Header, Footer, Nav) → `components/layout/[name]/`\n3. **Design primitive** (Button, Card, Input) → Use ShadCN or `components/ui/`\n4. **Small utility** (Icon, Logo) → `components/` root\n\n## Styling Rules\n\n- Always use `rounded-none` (no border radius)\n- Always include dark mode: `dark:` variants\n- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames\n- Follow design system in `docs/design-system.md`\n```\n\n#### 2. Create file organization rule file\n\n**File**: `.claude/rules/file-organization.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\npaths: src/**/*.{tsx,ts,js}\n---\n\n# File Organization Rules\n\n## Required Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/              # Next.js App Router ONLY\n├── components/       # React components\n│   ├── layout/       # Structural (Header, Footer)\n│   ├── sections/     # Page sections (Hero, FAQ)\n│   ├── ui/           # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   └── [feature]/    # Feature-specific (bento/)\n├── providers/        # React Context providers\n├── lib/              # Utilities and helpers\n├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks (when needed)\n└── types/            # TypeScript definitions (when needed)\n```\n\n## File Placement Rules\n\n| File Type | Location | Example |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Page routes | `app/[route]/page.tsx` | `app/about/page.tsx` |\n| Layouts | `app/[route]/layout.tsx` | `app/layout.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/[Name]Provider.tsx` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/[name].ts` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n| Custom hooks | `hooks/use[Name].ts` | `hooks/useAnimation.ts` |\n| Type definitions | `types/[domain].ts` | `types/api.ts` |\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n- **Components**: PascalCase (`DataVaultCard.tsx`)\n- **Utilities**: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)\n- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAnimation.ts`)\n- **Directories**: kebab-case (`flow-section/`)\n\n## Import Patterns\n\nUse barrel exports from index.ts files:\n\n```typescript\n// Good - uses barrel export\nimport { Header, Footer } from \"@/components/layout\";\nimport { Hero, FAQ } from \"@/components/sections\";\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \"@/providers\";\n\n// Avoid - direct file imports for organized components\nimport Header from \"@/components/layout/header/Header\";\n```\n\n## Protected Directories\n\n- `components/ui/` - ShadCN primitives, never modify directly\n- `app/fonts/` - Font files, do not add components here\n```\n\n#### 3. Update settings.json with protection rules\n\n**File**: `.claude/settings.json`\n\nAdd to existing permissions:\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"deny\": [\n      \"Edit(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Write(./.claude/hooks/**)\",\n      \"Edit(./src/components/ui/**)\",\n      \"Write(./src/components/ui/**)\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"hooks\": {\n    // ... existing hooks unchanged\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Rule files exist: `ls -la .claude/rules/`\n- [x] Settings.json is valid JSON: `cat .claude/settings.json | jq .`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Start new Claude Code session and verify rules are loaded\n- [ ] Ask Claude to create a new section component - should go to `components/sections/`\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Update Documentation\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate CLAUDE.md and related documentation to reflect the new structure.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update CLAUDE.md Project Structure section\n\n**File**: `CLAUDE.md`\n\nReplace the Project Structure section with:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/\n│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout, fonts, providers\n│   ├── page.tsx        # Landing page (orchestrates sections)\n│   ├── globals.css     # CSS variables, base styles\n│   └── fonts/          # Local font files\n├── components/\n│   ├── layout/         # Structural components\n│   │   ├── header/     # Header component\n│   │   └── footer/     # Footer component\n│   ├── sections/       # Page content blocks\n│   │   ├── hero/\n│   │   ├── flow-section/\n│   │   ├── bento-features/\n│   │   ├── team-credentials/\n│   │   ├── faq/\n│   │   └── secondary-cta/\n│   ├── ui/             # ShadCN primitives (DO NOT MODIFY)\n│   ├── bento/          # Bento grid card components\n│   ├── Icon.tsx        # Icon utility\n│   ├── Logo.tsx        # Logo component\n│   └── ThemeToggle.tsx # Theme toggle button\n├── providers/\n│   └── ThemeProvider.tsx  # Theme context\n├── lib/\n│   └── utils.ts        # cn() utility\ndocs/\n└── design-system.md    # Complete design guide\nthoughts/shared/\n├── plans/              # Implementation plans\n├── research/           # Analysis documents\n└── handoffs/           # Session handoffs\n```\n\n## File Placement Conventions\n\n| Component Type | Location | Example |\n|----------------|----------|---------|\n| Page sections | `components/sections/[name]/` | `sections/hero/Hero.tsx` |\n| Layout (Header/Footer) | `components/layout/[name]/` | `layout/header/Header.tsx` |\n| UI primitives | `components/ui/` | `ui/button.tsx` |\n| Context providers | `providers/` | `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` |\n| Utilities | `lib/` | `lib/utils.ts` |\n\n### Creating New Components\n\n1. **Page section** (Hero, Features, FAQ-style):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/sections/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n2. **Layout component** (Header, Footer, Nav):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir src/components/layout/[name]\n   # Create [Name].tsx and index.ts\n   ```\n\n3. **ShadCN component**:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component]\n   # Creates in components/ui/ - DO NOT MODIFY\n   # Create wrapper in components/ if needed\n   ```\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] CLAUDE.md is valid markdown\n- [x] Build still succeeds: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects new structure\n- [ ] New Claude Code sessions understand file placement\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated Tests:\n- Build succeeds without errors\n- Dev server starts correctly\n- All imports resolve\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `pnpm dev` and verify landing page renders\n2. Check all sections are visible and styled correctly\n3. Verify theme toggle works\n4. Verify Header sticky behavior\n5. Verify Footer renders at bottom\n6.
