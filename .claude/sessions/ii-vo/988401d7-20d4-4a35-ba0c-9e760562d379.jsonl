Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n\n2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n\n   **For codebase research:**\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)\n   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to find examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.\n\n   **For thoughts directory:**\n   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic\n   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)\n\n   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n\n   **For Linear tickets (if relevant):**\n   - Use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details of a specific ticket\n   - Use the **linear-searcher** agent to find related tickets or historical context\n\n   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings to document how they work\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n   - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving\n\n4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/allison/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n\n5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**\n   - Run the `hack/spec_metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata\n   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n     - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n       - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n       - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic\n     - Examples:\n       - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n       - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`\n\n6. **Generate research document:**\n   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4\n   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n     ```markdown\n     ---\n     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]\n     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     git_commit: [Current commit hash]\n     branch: [Current branch name]\n     repository: [Repository name]\n     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n     status: complete\n     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]\n     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]\n     ---\n\n     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]\n     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]\n     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]\n     **Repository**: [Repository name]\n\n     ## Research Question\n     [Original user query]\n\n     ## Summary\n     [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]\n\n     ## Detailed Findings\n\n     ### [Component/Area 1]\n     - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))\n     - How it connects to other components\n     - Current implementation details (without evaluation)\n\n     ### [Component/Area 2]\n     ...\n\n     ## Code References\n     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there\n     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block\n\n     ## Architecture Documentation\n     [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]\n\n     ## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n     [Relevant insights from thoughts/ directory with references]\n     - `thoughts/shared/something.md` - Historical decision about X\n     - `thoughts/local/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y\n     Note: Paths exclude \"searchable/\" even if found there\n\n     ## Related Research\n     [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]\n\n     ## Open Questions\n     [Any areas that need further investigation]\n     ```\n\n7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**\n   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`\n   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:\n     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`\n     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`\n   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document\n\n8. **Sync and present findings:**\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the thoughts directory\n   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user\n   - Include key file references for easy navigation\n   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification\n\n9. **Handle follow-up questions:**\n   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document\n   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update\n   - Add `last_updated_note: \"Added follow-up research for [brief description]\"` to frontmatter\n   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`\n   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation\n   - Continue updating the document and syncing\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage\n- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents\n- The thoughts/ directory provides historical context to supplement live findings\n- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference\n- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context\n- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations\n- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact\n- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)\n- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references\n- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading\n- Have sub-agents document examples and usage patterns as they exist\n- Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory\n- **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators\n- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE\n- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase\n- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks\n- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly\n  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)\n  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)\n  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)\n  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values\n- **Path handling**: The thoughts/searchable/ directory contains hard links for searching\n  - Always document paths by removing ONLY \"searchable/\" - preserve all other subdirectories\n  - Examples of correct transformations:\n    - `thoughts/searchable/allison/old_stuff/notes.md` → `thoughts/allison/old_stuff/notes.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/shared/prs/123.md` → `thoughts/shared/prs/123.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/global/shared/templates.md` → `thoughts/global/shared/templates.md`\n  - NEVER change allison/ to shared/ or vice versa - preserve the exact directory structure\n  - This ensures paths are correct for editing and navigation\n- **Frontmatter consistency**:\n  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents\n  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents\n  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research\n  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)\n  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied\n\n\nARGUMENTS: compare the configs set in the stylings and @docs/design-system.md"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"88c176de-31a9-4003-9539-c0b52c703af1","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:23:26.907Z"}

Let me analyze and compare them with the design system documentation.\n\n## Key differences I'm noticing:\n\n### 1. CSS Variables - Color Values\n\n**Design System (docs/design-system.md) specifies hex colors:**\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode */\n  --background: #FFFFFF;\n  --foreground: #171717;\n  --card: #FFFFFF;\n  --card-foreground: #171717;\n  --primary: #171717;\n  --primary-foreground: #FAFAFA;\n  --secondary: #F5F5F5;\n  --secondary-foreground: #171717;\n  --muted: #F5F5F5;\n  --muted-foreground: #737373;\n  --border: #E5E5E5;\n  --input: #E5E5E5;\n  --ring: #A3A3A3;\n  --destructive: #DC2626;\n}\n\n.dark {\n  /* Dark mode */\n  --background: #000000;\n  --foreground: #FAFAFA;\n  --card: #171717;\n  --card-foreground: #FAFAFA;\n  --primary: #E5E5E5;\n  --primary-foreground: #171717;\n  --secondary: #262626;\n  --secondary-foreground: #FAFAFA;\n  --muted: #262626;\n  --muted-foreground: #A3A3A3;\n  --border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);\n  --input: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);\n  --ring: #737373;\n}\n```\n\n**Actual globals.css uses OKLCH colors:**\n```css\n:root {\n  --muted: oklch(0.97 0 0);\n  --border: oklch(0.922 0 0);\n  --radius: 0.625rem;  /* <-- NOT 0px as design system says */\n  --background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nI see significant color model discrepancies. The design system uses traditional hex colors, while the actual implementation switches to OKLCH, a more perceptually uniform color space. This suggests a deliberate color management strategy that differs from the original documentation.\n\nThe color transformation isn't just a simple conversion but appears to be a thoughtful reimagining of the color palette. The OKLCH model allows for more nuanced color representation, potentially improving visual consistency across different displays and color spaces.\n\nThe radius configuration reveals an even more striking deviation. Despite explicit design system guidance for sharp, 0px corners, the actual implementation uses a 0.625rem rounded radius. This isn't a minor oversight but a fundamental design philosophy divergence.\n\nThe radius variables create a sophisticated scaling system, with subtle incremental adjustments:\n- Small radius subtracts 4px\n- Medium radius subtracts 2px\n- Large radius matches base radius\n- Extra-large radius adds 4px\n\nThis suggests a carefully considered approach to corner rounding that provides visual hierarchy and consistency across different UI components.\n\nThe font configuration demonstrates precise alignment. While the syntax differs between design system and implementation, the core intent remains intact. CSS variables are leveraged to create flexible typography references, with Next.js font loading mechanisms seamlessly integrated.\n\nShadow tokens present a clear gap. The design system meticulously documents shadow variations, yet the current implementation lacks these critical style definitions. This omission could impact visual consistency and design precision.\n\nAnimation patterns show remarkable fidelity. Both pulse and scroll animations match the design system specifications exactly, indicating careful implementation of motion design principles.\n\nThe dark mode background reveals a nuanced color choice. Instead of pure black, a dark gray (oklch) is used, suggesting a more sophisticated approach to dark mode aesthetics that avoids harsh absolute black while maintaining a deep, neutral tone.\n\nThe ShadCN configuration introduces slight deviations from the original design system. The \"new-york\" style and \"neutral\" base color represent intentional stylistic adaptations that diverge from initial guidelines.","signature":"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

Several discrepancies exist between the actual implementation in `src/app/globals.css` and the documentation in `docs/design-system.md`.\n\n## Configuration Files Analyzed\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `src/app/globals.css:1-297` | Main CSS variables and animations |\n| `src/app/layout.tsx:1-47` | Font configuration |\n| `postcss.config.mjs:1-8` | PostCSS/Tailwind v4 plugin |\n| `components.json:1-23` | ShadCN UI configuration |\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1. Color Format Difference\n\n**Design System (lines 146-181)** specifies hex colors:\n```css\n--background: #FFFFFF;\n--foreground: #171717;\n--primary: #171717;\n--muted-foreground: #737373;\n```\n\n**Actual globals.css (lines 6-39)** uses OKLCH color space:\n```css\n--background: oklch(1 0 0);\n--foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n--primary: oklch(0.205 0 0);\n--muted-foreground: oklch(0.556 0 0);\n```\n\n**Impact**: Functionally equivalent for grayscale, but documentation doesn't reflect actual format.\n\n### 2. Border Radius - MAJOR DISCREPANCY\n\n**Design System** states throughout:\n- \"Sharp corners (0px radius everywhere)\" (line 37)\n- \"Border radius: Always 0 (`rounded-none`)\" (line 1501)\n\n**Actual globals.css (lines 9, 75-78)**:\n```css\n--radius: 0.625rem;\n--radius-sm: calc(var(--radius) - 4px);\n--radius-md: calc(var(--radius) - 2px);\n--radius-lg: var(--radius);\n--radius-xl: calc(var(--radius) + 4px);\n```\n\n**Impact**: Components using `rounded-*` classes will have rounded corners, contradicting the \"Technical Blueprint\" aesthetic.\n\n### 3. Dark Mode Background\n\n**Design System (line 166)** specifies pure black:\n```css\n--background: #000000;\n```\n\n**Actual globals.css (line 224)**:\n```css\n--background: oklch(0.145 0 0);  /* ≈ #242424, dark gray */\n```\n\n**Impact**: Dark mode is not true black as documented.\n\n### 4. Card Background in Dark Mode\n\n**Design System (line 169)** specifies:\n```css\n--card: #171717;\n```\n\n**Actual globals.css (line 226)**:\n```css\n--card: oklch(0.205 0 0);  /* ≈ #333333, different shade */\n```\n\n### 5. Font Configuration - MATCHES\n\n**Design System (lines 198-211)**:\n```tsx\nconst switzer = localFont({\n  src: [...],\n  variable: \"--font-switzer\",\n  display: \"swap\",\n});\nconst geistMono = Geist_Mono({\n  variable: \"--font-geist-mono\",\n  subsets: [\"latin\"],\n});\n```\n\n**Actual layout.tsx (lines 7-25)**: Identical implementation.\n\n### 6. Shadow System - NOT IMPLEMENTED\n\n**Design System (lines 342-354)** documents shadow tokens:\n```css\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), ...;\n--shadow-card-hover: ...;\n--shadow-lg: ...;\n--shadow-xl: ...;\n```\n\n**Actual globals.css**: No shadow CSS variables defined.\n\n**Impact**: Components rely on Tailwind's default shadows rather than documented custom values.\n\n### 7. Animation Definitions - MATCHES\n\n**Design System (lines 1273-1297)** describes:\n```css\n@keyframes pulse-subtle { ... }\n.animate-pulse-slow { animation: pulse-subtle 3s ease-in-out infinite; }\n@keyframes scroll { ... }\n.animate-scroll { animation: scroll linear infinite; }\n```\n\n**Actual globals.css (lines 86-282)**: Implements these plus additional circuit-signal and flow-signal animations not documented in the design system.\n\n### 8. ShadCN Configuration\n\n**components.json** settings:\n- Style: `new-york`\n- Base color: `neutral`\n- CSS variables: enabled\n- Icon library: `lucide`\n\n**Design System** references:\n- Uses Zinc color scale (lines 72-84), but ShadCN is configured with `neutral`\n- Documents ShadcnUI as base (line 48)\n\n### 9. Theme Configuration - MATCHES\n\n**@theme inline block (globals.css lines 41-79)** correctly maps CSS variables to Tailwind v4 theme using:\n```css\n@theme inline {\n  --color-background: var(--background);\n  --font-sans: var(--font-switzer);\n  --font-mono: var(--font-geist-mono);\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### 10. Base Layer Styles - MATCHES\n\n**globals.css (lines 284-296)**:\n```css\n@layer base {\n  * { @apply border-border outline-ring/50; }\n  body { @apply bg-background text-foreground; }\n}\n```\n\nProperly applies background and text colors to body.\n\n## Comparison Table\n\n| Setting | Design System | Actual Config | Status |\n|---------|---------------|---------------|--------|\n| Color format | Hex | OKLCH | Different |\n| Border radius | 0px | 0.625rem | **MISMATCH** |\n| Dark background | #000000 | ~#242424 | **MISMATCH** |\n| Dark card | #171717 | ~#333333 | **MISMATCH** |\n| Font stack | Switzer + Geist Mono | Switzer + Geist Mono | Match |\n| Shadow tokens | Defined | Not defined | **MISSING** |\n| Pulse animation | 3s ease-in-out | 3s ease-in-out | Match |\n| Scroll animation | linear infinite | linear infinite | Match |\n\n## Code References\n\n- `src/app/globals.css:9` - Border radius set to 0.625rem\n- `src/app/globals.css:224` - Dark mode background not pure black\n- `src/app/globals.css:226` - Dark mode card different shade\n- `src/app/layout.tsx:7-25` - Font configuration\n- `components.json:9` - ShadCN base color is \"neutral\"\n- `docs/design-system.md:37` - Documents \"sharp corners\"\n- `docs/design-system.md:166` - Documents pure black background\n\n## Architecture Documentation\n\nThe project uses:\n1. **Tailwind CSS v4** with CSS-based configuration (no tailwind.config.js)\n2. **PostCSS** with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin\n3. **OKLCH color space** for all CSS variables\n4. **ShadCN UI** \"new-york\" style with \"neutral\" base color\n5. **next-themes** for dark mode via ThemeProvider\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should `--radius` be set to `0` to match the design system's \"sharp corners\" principle?\n2. Should dark mode background be true `oklch(0 0 0)` (#000000)?\n3. Should shadow CSS variables be added to globals.css?\n4. Should documentation be updated to reflect OKLCH color format?\n5.

You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n\n    - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n    - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n    - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n\n    - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n    - Research documents\n    - Related implementation plans\n    - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n    - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n    - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n    - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**: Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n    - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n    - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n    - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n    - If a Linear ticket is mentioned, use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details\n\n    These agents will:\n\n    - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n    - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)\n    - Trace data flow and key functions\n    - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n\n    - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n    - Read them FULLY into the main context\n    - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n\n    - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n    - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n    - Note assumptions that need verification\n    - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n\n    ```\n    Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n    I've found that:\n    - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n    - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n    - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n    Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n    - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n    - [Business logic clarification]\n    - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n    ```\n\n    Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n\n    - DO NOT just accept the correction\n    - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n    - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n    - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n\n    - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n    - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n    **For deeper investigation:**\n\n    - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n    - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n    - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n    **For historical context:**\n\n    - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n    - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n    **For related tickets:**\n\n    - **linear-searcher** - To find similar issues or past implementations\n\n    Each agent knows how to:\n\n    - Find the right files and code patterns\n    - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n    - Look for integration points and dependencies\n    - Return specific file:line references\n    - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n\n    ```\n    Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n    **Current State:**\n    - [Key discovery about existing code]\n    - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n    **Design Options:**\n    1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n    2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n    **Open Questions:**\n    - [Technical uncertainty]\n    - [Design decision needed]\n\n    Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n\n    ```\n    Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n    ## Overview\n    [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n    ## Implementation Phases:\n    1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n    2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n    3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n    Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n    ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n    - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n        - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n        - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n        - description is a brief kebab-case description\n    - Examples:\n        - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n        - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-improve-error-handling.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n````markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n\n-   [Important finding with file:line reference]\n-   [Pattern to follow]\n-   [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext` **Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n-   [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n-   [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n-   [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n-   [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n-   [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n-   [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n-   [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n\n-   [What to test]\n-   [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n\n-   [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n-   Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n-   Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n-   Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n````\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n\n    - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the newly created plan\n    - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n\n    ```\n    I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n    `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n\n    Please review it and let me know:\n    - Are the phases properly scoped?\n    - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n    - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n    - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n    ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n\n    - Add missing phases\n    - Adjust technical approach\n    - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n    - Add/remove scope items\n    - After making changes, run `humanlayer thoughts sync` again\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n\n    - Question vague requirements\n    - Identify potential issues early\n    - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n    - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n\n    - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n    - Get buy-in at each major step\n    - Allow course corrections\n    - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n\n    - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n    - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n    - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n    - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n    - automated steps should use `make` whenever possible - for example `make -C humanlayer-wui check` instead of `cd humanlayer-wui && bun run fmt`\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n\n    - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n    - Consider migration and rollback\n    - Think about edge cases\n    - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n\n    - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n    - Update todos as you complete research\n    - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n    - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n    - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n    - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n    - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n    - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n\n    - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n    - Specific files that should exist\n    - Code compilation/type checking\n    - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n    - UI/UX functionality\n    - Performance under real conditions\n    - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n    - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n-   [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n-   [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n-   [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n\n-   [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n-   [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n-   [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n-   [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n\n-   Start with schema/migration\n-   Add store methods\n-   Update business logic\n-   Expose via API\n-   Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n\n-   Research existing patterns first\n-   Start with data model\n-   Build backend logic\n-   Add API endpoints\n-   Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n\n-   Document current behavior\n-   Plan incremental changes\n-   Maintain backwards compatibility\n-   Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n    - Exactly what to search for\n    - Which directories to focus on\n    - What information to extract\n    - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n    - If the ticket mentions \"WUI\", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory\n    - If it mentions \"daemon\", specify `hld/` directory\n    - Never use generic terms like \"UI\" when you mean \"WUI\"\n    - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n    - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n    - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n    - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /create_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon.

Where shadows would be used\n\nI should spawn research tasks to understand the impact before proposing a plan.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4169,"cache_read_input_tokens":58466,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4169,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWVNjGP5KqsVCLSC7R8Ve","type":"assistant","uuid":"a7842b5f-ebe1-4cfc-83a3-9506967bb34a","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:27:01.020Z"}

Components reference this color via the `bg-background` Tailwind utility class, which is applied through Tailwind's semantic color system.\n\n### Dark Mode Implementation\n\n#### 1. CSS Variable Definition (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/globals.css:224`)\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0.145 0 0);  /* ~#242424 dark gray */\n}\n```\n\nThe light mode equivalent at line 10:\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: oklch(1 0 0);  /* #FFFFFF pure white */\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Tailwind Color Mapping (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/globals.css:42`)\n```css\n@theme inline {\n  --color-background: var(--background);\n}\n```\n\nThis maps the CSS variable to Tailwind's `bg-background` utility class.\n\n#### 3. Global Body Application (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/globals.css:289`)\n```css\nbody {\n  @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Theme Toggle Mechanism (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx:37`)\n```typescript\ndocument.documentElement.classList.toggle(\"dark\", theme === \"dark\");\n```\n\nWhen dark mode is active, this adds the `.dark` class to `<html>`, triggering the dark mode CSS variables.\n\n### Components Using `bg-background`\n\n#### Section-Level Components (Full-Width Backgrounds)\n\n1. **TeamCredentialsSection** (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx:44`)\n   -

Default background: `bg-background`\n   - Used by all bento cards and decorative containers\n\n6. **Button - Primary Variant** (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/Button.tsx:21`)\n   - Primary button: `bg-background text-black dark:text-white border border-black dark:border-white hover:bg-zinc-100 dark:hover:bg-zinc-800`\n\n#### Navigation Components\n\n7. **Header** (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/Header.tsx:26-27`)\n   -

All components already explicitly use `rounded-none`. The design system is being followed - only the CSS variables need cleanup.\n\n### Dark Mode Background\n**Current**: `oklch(0.145 0 0)` (~#242424) via `bg-background`\n**Affected**: 9 components + global body styles would change\n- TeamCredentialsSection, FlowSection, BentoFeatures, FAQ\n- Header, PlusCornerCard, Button (primary), DataVaultCard\n- Body element\n\n### Shadow Tokens\n**Finding**: Zero shadow usage in any components. The flat design with borders is intentional. Shadow tokens are documented for future use (dropdowns, modals) but not currently needed.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Plan Structure\n\n### Phase 1: CSS Variable Cleanup (Low Risk)\n- Set `--radius` to `0` in globals.css\n- This matches reality since no components use the variable anyway\n\n### Phase 2: Dark Mode Background (Visual Change)\n- Change `--background: oklch(0.145 0 0)` to `oklch(0 0 0)` (pure black)\n- Single line change with visual verification needed\n\n### Phase 3: Documentation Alignment (Optional)\n- Update design-system.md to use OKLCH format\n- Or add hex value comments alongside OKLCH\n\n---\n\n## Questions Before I Write the Plan\n\n1. **Shadow tokens**: Should I include adding them to globals.css now, or defer since nothing uses them yet?\n\n2. **Dark mode verification**: Would you like me to include specific visual verification steps (screenshot comparison)?\n\n3. **ShadCN base color**: The config uses \"neutral\" but docs reference \"zinc\".

Border Radius - Set to Zero\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css:9`\n\n**Current**:\n```css\n--radius: 0.625rem;\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```css\n--radius: 0;\n```\n\nNote: The derived radius variables (`--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, etc.) at lines 75-78 will automatically compute to 0 or negative values, which is fine since they're unused.\n\n#### 2. Dark Mode Background - Pure Black\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css:224`\n\n**Current**:\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0 0 0);\n```\n\n#### 3. Add Shadow Tokens\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Add after line 38** (after `--sidebar-ring` in `:root`):\n\n```css\n  /* Shadows */\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n```\n\n**Add after line 254** (after `--sidebar-ring` in `.dark`):\n\n```css\n  /* Shadows - darker for dark mode */\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  --shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n  --shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);\n```\n\n**Add to `@theme inline` block** (after line 78, before closing brace):\n\n```css\n  --shadow-sm: var(--shadow-sm);\n  --shadow-card: var(--shadow-card);\n  --shadow-card-hover: var(--shadow-card-hover);\n  --shadow-lg: var(--shadow-lg);\n  --shadow-xl: var(--shadow-xl);\n```\n\n#### 4. ShadCN Base Color - Change to Zinc\n\n**File**: `components.json:9`\n\n**Current**:\n```json\n\"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```json\n\"baseColor\": \"zinc\",\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Dev server starts without errors: `pnpm dev`\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] No CSS parsing errors in browser console\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Dark mode background is visibly pure black (not dark gray)\n- [ ] All existing components still render correctly\n- [ ] No visual regressions on landing page sections\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, run the dev server and toggle dark mode to verify the background change is visible.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated:\n- Build succeeds (`pnpm build`)\n- Dev server runs (`pnpm dev`)\n\n### Manual:\n1.

The design system is the source of truth.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n| Setting | Design System (Truth) | Actual Config | Action |\n|---------|----------------------|---------------|--------|\n| Border radius | 0px | `--radius: 0.625rem` | Change to 0 |\n| Dark background | #000000 | `oklch(0.145 0 0)` (~#242424) | Change to pure black |\n| Shadow tokens | 5 defined | None | Add to globals.css |\n| ShadCN base color | zinc | neutral | Change to zinc |\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n- `--radius` variable exists but is **not used** - all components already use `rounded-none` explicitly (`src/components/ui/Button.tsx:21-27`)\n- Dark background change affects 9 components via `bg-background` semantic class\n- Zero shadow usage in components currently - tokens are for future dropdowns/modals/toasts\n- ShadCN \"neutral\" and \"zinc\" are nearly identical but docs specify zinc\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation:\n1. `--radius` set to `0` in globals.css\n2. Dark mode `--background` is pure black `oklch(0 0 0)`\n3. Shadow CSS variables defined and available for use\n4. ShadCN configured with \"zinc\" base color\n5. All changes verified via dev server\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Updating design-system.md to use OKLCH format (config aligns to docs, not vice versa)\n- Adding shadow classes to existing components (tokens only)\n- Modifying any component files (only config changes)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nSingle-phase approach since all changes are in config files with no dependencies between them.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Config Alignment\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate globals.css and components.json to match design system specifications.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Border Radius - Set to Zero\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css:9`\n\n**Current**:\n```css\n--radius: 0.625rem;\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```css\n--radius: 0;\n```\n\nNote: The derived radius variables (`--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, etc.) at lines 75-78 will automatically compute to 0 or negative values, which is fine since they're unused.\n\n#### 2. Dark Mode Background - Pure Black\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css:224`\n\n**Current**:\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0 0 0);\n```\n\n#### 3. Add Shadow Tokens\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Add after line 38** (after `--sidebar-ring` in `:root`):\n\n```css\n  /* Shadows */\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n```\n\n**Add after line 254** (after `--sidebar-ring` in `.dark`):\n\n```css\n  /* Shadows - darker for dark mode */\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  --shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n  --shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);\n```\n\n**Add to `@theme inline` block** (after line 78, before closing brace):\n\n```css\n  --shadow-sm: var(--shadow-sm);\n  --shadow-card: var(--shadow-card);\n  --shadow-card-hover: var(--shadow-card-hover);\n  --shadow-lg: var(--shadow-lg);\n  --shadow-xl: var(--shadow-xl);\n```\n\n#### 4. ShadCN Base Color - Change to Zinc\n\n**File**: `components.json:9`\n\n**Current**:\n```json\n\"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```json\n\"baseColor\": \"zinc\",\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Dev server starts without errors: `pnpm dev`\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] No CSS parsing errors in browser console\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Dark mode background is visibly pure black (not dark gray)\n- [ ] All existing components still render correctly\n- [ ] No visual regressions on landing page sections\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, run the dev server and toggle dark mode to verify the background change is visible.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated:\n- Build succeeds (`pnpm build`)\n- Dev server runs (`pnpm dev`)\n\n### Manual:\n1. Open landing page in browser\n2. Toggle to dark mode\n3. Verify background is pure black\n4. Scroll through all sections to check for visual issues\n5. Toggle back to light mode to verify no regressions\n\n## References\n\n- Design system: `docs/design-system.md:146-181` (CSS variables)\n- Design system: `docs/design-system.md:342-354` (shadow tokens)\n- Research: `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-26-styling-config-vs-design-system.md`\n- Current globals.css: `src/app/globals.css`\n- ShadCN config: `components.json`\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

So the plan is ready for implementation.\n\nLet me verify the shadow values I used match the design system:\n\nFrom design-system.md lines 342-354:\n```css\n/* Light mode shadows */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n\n/* Dark mode shadows (deeper, less visible) */\n--shadow-card-dark: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n--shadow-card-hover-dark: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n--shadow-lg-dark: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\nI notice the design system has different names for dark mode shadows (with `-dark` suffix) and doesn't have `--shadow-sm-dark` or `--shadow-xl-dark`. \n\nI'll cross-reference my plan's dark mode shadow values with the design system documentation. My implementation seems to have slightly different shadow intensities compared to the official design tokens.\n\nThe design system provides specific guidance for card and large shadows in dark mode, indicating my extrapolated small and extra-large shadow values need verification. I'll need to confirm the precise shadow specifications with the design team to ensure visual consistency.\n\nMy current approach requires refinement. By using CSS custom properties with `.dark` selector overrides, I can implement theme switching more authentically. However, I must strictly adhere to documented dark mode shadow values, which currently cover only card and large shadow variations.\n\nI'll evaluate two potential strategies: limit shadow variables to documented dark mode values or include all five with clear annotations about extrapolated ranges. Precision and design system alignment are critical.\n\nThe safest implementation involves preserving light mode shadows exactly, incorporating the three documented dark mode shadows precisely, and making a deliberate choice about handling shadow-sm and shadow-xl dark mode variations.\n\nI'll prioritize the user's guidance to strictly adhere to documented values. This means selectively applying shadows, ensuring visual consistency while respecting the design system's explicit specifications. The approach minimizes potential design inconsistencies by using only the officially defined shadow values.","signature":"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

The design system is the source of truth.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n| Setting | Design System (Truth) | Actual Config | Action |\n|---------|----------------------|---------------|--------|\n| Border radius | 0px | `--radius: 0.625rem` | Change to 0 |\n| Dark background | #000000 | `oklch(0.145 0 0)` (~#242424) | Change to pure black |\n| Shadow tokens | 5 defined | None | Add to globals.css |\n| ShadCN base color | zinc | neutral | Change to zinc |\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n- `--radius` variable exists but is **not used** - all components already use `rounded-none` explicitly (`src/components/ui/Button.tsx:21-27`)\n- Dark background change affects 9 components via `bg-background` semantic class\n- Zero shadow usage in components currently - tokens are for future dropdowns/modals/toasts\n- ShadCN \"neutral\" and \"zinc\" are nearly identical but docs specify zinc\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation:\n1. `--radius` set to `0` in globals.css\n2. Dark mode `--background` is pure black `oklch(0 0 0)`\n3. Shadow CSS variables defined and available for use\n4. ShadCN configured with \"zinc\" base color\n5. All changes verified via dev server\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Updating design-system.md to use OKLCH format (config aligns to docs, not vice versa)\n- Adding shadow classes to existing components (tokens only)\n- Modifying any component files (only config changes)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nSingle-phase approach since all changes are in config files with no dependencies between them.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Config Alignment\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate globals.css and components.json to match design system specifications.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1.

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n- **Pause for human verification**: After completing all automated verification for a phase, pause and inform the human that the phase is ready for manual testing. Use this format:\n  ```\n  Phase [N] Complete - Ready for Manual Verification\n\n  Automated verification passed:\n  - [List automated checks that passed]\n\n  Please perform the manual verification steps listed in the plan:\n  - [List manual verification items from the plan]\n\n  Let me know when manual testing is complete so I can proceed to Phase [N+1].\n  ```\n\nIf instructed to execute multiple phases consecutively, skip the pause until the last phase. Otherwise, assume you are just doing one phase.\n\ndo not check off items in the manual testing steps until confirmed by the user.\n\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"3ec2a420-c5bd-4f52-a72a-ebaaee1b1187","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:42:05.825Z"}

The design system is the source of truth.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n| Setting | Design System (Truth) | Actual Config | Action |\n|---------|----------------------|---------------|--------|\n| Border radius | 0px | `--radius: 0.625rem` | Change to 0 |\n| Dark background | #000000 | `oklch(0.145 0 0)` (~#242424) | Change to pure black |\n| Shadow tokens | 5 defined | None | Add to globals.css |\n| ShadCN base color | zinc | neutral | Change to zinc |\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n- `--radius` variable exists but is **not used** - all components already use `rounded-none` explicitly (`src/components/ui/Button.tsx:21-27`)\n- Dark background change affects 9 components via `bg-background` semantic class\n- Zero shadow usage in components currently - tokens are for future dropdowns/modals/toasts\n- ShadCN \"neutral\" and \"zinc\" are nearly identical but docs specify zinc\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation:\n1. `--radius` set to `0` in globals.css\n2. Dark mode `--background` is pure black `oklch(0 0 0)`\n3. Shadow CSS variables defined and available for use\n4. ShadCN configured with \"zinc\" base color\n5. All changes verified via dev server\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Updating design-system.md to use OKLCH format (config aligns to docs, not vice versa)\n- Adding shadow classes to existing components (tokens only)\n- Modifying any component files (only config changes)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nSingle-phase approach since all changes are in config files with no dependencies between them.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Config Alignment\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate globals.css and components.json to match design system specifications.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Border Radius - Set to Zero\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css:9`\n\n**Current**:\n```css\n--radius: 0.625rem;\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```css\n--radius: 0;\n```\n\nNote: The derived radius variables (`--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, etc.) at lines 75-78 will automatically compute to 0 or negative values, which is fine since they're unused.\n\n#### 2. Dark Mode Background - Pure Black\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css:224`\n\n**Current**:\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0 0 0);\n```\n\n#### 3. Add Shadow Tokens\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Add after line 38** (after `--sidebar-ring` in `:root`):\n\n```css\n  /* Shadows */\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n```\n\n**Add after line 254** (after `--sidebar-ring` in `.dark`):\n\n```css\n  /* Shadows - darker for dark mode (only 3 specified in design system) */\n  --shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n  --shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\nNote: Design system only specifies dark mode overrides for card, card-hover, and lg shadows. The sm and xl shadows will inherit light mode values in dark mode.\n\n**Add to `@theme inline` block** (after line 78, before closing brace):\n\n```css\n  --shadow-sm: var(--shadow-sm);\n  --shadow-card: var(--shadow-card);\n  --shadow-card-hover: var(--shadow-card-hover);\n  --shadow-lg: var(--shadow-lg);\n  --shadow-xl: var(--shadow-xl);\n```\n\n#### 4. ShadCN Base Color - Change to Zinc\n\n**File**: `components.json:9`\n\n**Current**:\n```json\n\"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```json\n\"baseColor\": \"zinc\",\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Dev server starts without errors: `pnpm dev`\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] No CSS parsing errors in browser console\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Dark mode background is visibly pure black (not dark gray)\n- [ ] All existing components still render correctly\n- [ ] No visual regressions on landing page sections\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, run the dev server and toggle dark mode to verify the background change is visible.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated:\n- Build succeeds (`pnpm build`)\n- Dev server runs (`pnpm dev`)\n\n### Manual:\n1. Open landing page in browser\n2. Toggle to dark mode\n3. Verify background is pure black\n4. Scroll through all sections to check for visual issues\n5. Toggle back to light mode to verify no regressions\n\n## References\n\n- Design system: `docs/design-system.md:146-181` (CSS variables)\n- Design system: `docs/design-system.md:342-354` (shadow tokens)\n- Research: `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-26-styling-config-vs-design-system.md`\n- Current globals.css: `src/app/globals.css`\n- ShadCN config: `components.json`\n","numLines":170,"startLine":1,"totalLines":170}}}

The design system is the source of truth.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n| Setting | Design System (Truth) | Actual Config | Action |\n|---------|----------------------|---------------|--------|\n| Border radius | 0px | `--radius: 0.625rem` | Change to 0 |\n| Dark background | #000000 | `oklch(0.145 0 0)` (~#242424) | Change to pure black |\n| Shadow tokens | 5 defined | None | Add to globals.css |\n| ShadCN base color | zinc | neutral | Change to zinc |\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n- `--radius` variable exists but is **not used** - all components already use `rounded-none` explicitly (`src/components/ui/Button.tsx:21-27`)\n- Dark background change affects 9 components via `bg-background` semantic class\n- Zero shadow usage in components currently - tokens are for future dropdowns/modals/toasts\n- ShadCN \"neutral\" and \"zinc\" are nearly identical but docs specify zinc\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation:\n1. `--radius` set to `0` in globals.css\n2. Dark mode `--background` is pure black `oklch(0 0 0)`\n3. Shadow CSS variables defined and available for use\n4. ShadCN configured with \"zinc\" base color\n5. All changes verified via dev server\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Updating design-system.md to use OKLCH format (config aligns to docs, not vice versa)\n- Adding shadow classes to existing components (tokens only)\n- Modifying any component files (only config changes)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nSingle-phase approach since all changes are in config files with no dependencies between them.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Config Alignment\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate globals.css and components.json to match design system specifications.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Border Radius - Set to Zero\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css:9`\n\n**Current**:\n```css\n--radius: 0.625rem;\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```css\n--radius: 0;\n```\n\nNote: The derived radius variables (`--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, etc.) at lines 75-78 will automatically compute to 0 or negative values, which is fine since they're unused.\n\n#### 2. Dark Mode Background - Pure Black\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css:224`\n\n**Current**:\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0 0 0);\n```\n\n#### 3. Add Shadow Tokens\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n\n**Add after line 38** (after `--sidebar-ring` in `:root`):\n\n```css\n  /* Shadows */\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n```\n\n**Add after line 254** (after `--sidebar-ring` in `.dark`):\n\n```css\n  /* Shadows - darker for dark mode (only 3 specified in design system) */\n  --shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n  --shadow-card-hover: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n```\n\nNote: Design system only specifies dark mode overrides for card, card-hover, and lg shadows. The sm and xl shadows will inherit light mode values in dark mode.\n\n**Add to `@theme inline` block** (after line 78, before closing brace):\n\n```css\n  --shadow-sm: var(--shadow-sm);\n  --shadow-card: var(--shadow-card);\n  --shadow-card-hover: var(--shadow-card-hover);\n  --shadow-lg: var(--shadow-lg);\n  --shadow-xl: var(--shadow-xl);\n```\n\n#### 4. ShadCN Base Color - Change to Zinc\n\n**File**: `components.json:9`\n\n**Current**:\n```json\n\"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```json\n\"baseColor\": \"zinc\",\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Dev server starts without errors: `pnpm dev`\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] No CSS parsing errors in browser console\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Dark mode background is visibly pure black (not dark gray)\n- [ ] All existing components still render correctly\n- [ ] No visual regressions on landing page sections\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, run the dev server and toggle dark mode to verify the background change is visible.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated:\n- Build succeeds (`pnpm build`)\n- Dev server runs (`pnpm dev`)\n\n### Manual:\n1. Open landing page in browser\n2. Toggle to dark mode\n3. Verify background is pure black\n4. Scroll through all sections to check for visual issues\n5. Toggle back to light mode to verify no regressions\n\n## References\n\n- Design system: `docs/design-system.md:146-181` (CSS variables)\n- Design system: `docs/design-system.md:342-354` (shadow tokens)\n- Research: `thoughts/shared/research/2025-12-26-styling-config-vs-design-system.md`\n- Current globals.css: `src/app/globals.css`\n- ShadCN config: `components.json`\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":134,"oldLines":8,"newStart":134,"newLines":8,"lines":[" ### Success Criteria"," "," #### Automated Verification:","-- [ ] Dev server starts without errors: `pnpm dev`","-- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`","+- [x] Dev server starts without errors: `pnpm dev`","+- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`"," - [ ] No CSS parsing errors in browser console"," "," #### Manual Verification:"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

The design system is the source of truth.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n| Setting | Design System (Truth) | Actual Config | Action |\n|---------|----------------------|---------------|--------|\n| Border radius | 0px | `--radius: 0.625rem` | Change to 0 |\n| Dark background | #000000 | `oklch(0.145 0 0)` (~#242424) | Change to pure black |\n| Shadow tokens | 5 defined | None | Add to globals.css |\n| ShadCN base color | zinc | neutral | Change to zinc |\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n- `--radius` variable exists but is **not used** - all components already use `rounded-none` explicitly (`src/components/ui/Button.tsx:21-27`)\n- Dark background change affects 9 components via `bg-background` semantic class\n- Zero shadow usage in components currently - tokens are for future dropdowns/modals/toasts\n- ShadCN \"neutral\" and \"zinc\" are nearly identical but docs specify zinc\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation:\n1. `--radius` set to `0` in globals.css\n2. Dark mode `--background` is pure black `oklch(0 0 0)`\n3. Shadow CSS variables defined and available for use\n4. ShadCN configured with \"zinc\" base color\n5. All changes verified via dev server\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Updating design-system.md to use OKLCH format (config aligns to docs, not vice versa)\n- Adding shadow classes to existing components (tokens only)\n- Modifying any component files (only config changes)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nSingle-phase approach since all changes are in config files with no dependencies between them.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Config Alignment\n\n### Overview\n\nUpdate globals.css and components.json to match design system specifications.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Border Radius - Set to Zero\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css:9`\n\n**Current**:\n```css\n--radius: 0.625rem;\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```css\n--radius: 0;\n```\n\nNote: The derived radius variables (`--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, etc.) at lines 75-78 will automatically compute to 0 or negative values, which is fine since they're unused.\n\n#### 2. Dark Mode Background - Pure Black\n\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css:224`\n\n**Current**:\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0 0 0);\n```\n\n#### 3.

The sm and xl shadows will inherit light mode values in dark mode.\n\n**Add to `@theme inline` block** (after line 78, before closing brace):\n\n```css\n  --shadow-sm: var(--shadow-sm);\n  --shadow-card: var(--shadow-card);\n  --shadow-card-hover: var(--shadow-card-hover);\n  --shadow-lg: var(--shadow-lg);\n  --shadow-xl: var(--shadow-xl);\n```\n\n#### 4. ShadCN Base Color - Change to Zinc\n\n**File**: `components.json:9`\n\n**Current**:\n```json\n\"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n```\n\n**Change to**:\n```json\n\"baseColor\": \"zinc\",\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Dev server starts without errors: `pnpm dev`\n- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] No CSS parsing errors in browser console\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Dark mode background is visibly pure black (not dark gray)\n- [ ] All existing components still render correctly\n- [ ] No visual regressions on landing page sections\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, run the dev server and toggle dark mode to verify the background change is visible.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated:\n- Build succeeds (`pnpm build`)\n- Dev server runs (`pnpm dev`)\n\n### Manual:\n1.
