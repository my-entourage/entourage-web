These handoffs contain critical context, learnings, and next steps from previous work sessions that need to be understood and continued.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **If the path to a handoff document was provided**:\n   - If a handoff document path was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read the handoff document FULLY\n   - Immediately read any research or plan documents that it links to under `thoughts/shared/plans` or `thoughts/shared/research`. do NOT use a sub-agent to read these critical files.\n   - Begin the analysis process by ingesting relevant context from the handoff document, reading additional files it mentions\n   - Then propose a course of action to the user and confirm, or ask for clarification on direction.\n\n2. **If a ticket number (like ENG-XXXX) was provided**:\n   - run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to ensure your `thoughts/` directory is up to date.\n   - locate the most recent handoff document for the ticket. Tickets will be located in `thoughts/shared/handoffs/ENG-XXXX` where `ENG-XXXX` is the ticket number. e.g. for `ENG-2124` the handoffs would be in `thoughts/shared/handoffs/ENG-2124/`. **List this directory's contents.**\n   - There may be zero, one or multiple files in the directory.\n   - **If there are zero files in the directory, or the directory does not exist**: tell the user: \"I'm sorry, I can't seem to find that handoff document. Can you please provide me with a path to it?\"\n   - **If there is only one file in the directory**: proceed with that handoff\n   - **If there are multiple files in the directory**: using the date and time specified in the file name (it will be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` in 24-hour time format), proceed with the _most recent_ handoff document.\n   - Immediately read the handoff document FULLY\n   - Immediately read any research or plan documents that it links to under `thoughts/shared/plans` or `thoughts/shared/research`; do NOT use a sub-agent to read these critical files.\n   - Begin the analysis process by ingesting relevant context from the handoff document, reading additional files it mentions\n   - Then propose a course of action to the user and confirm, or ask for clarification on direction.\n\n3. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you resume work from a handoff document. Let me find the available handoffs.\n\nWhich handoff would you like to resume from?\n\nTip: You can invoke this command directly with a handoff path: `/resume_handoff `thoughts/shared/handoffs/ENG-XXXX/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_ENG-XXXX_description.md`\n\nor using a ticket number to resume from the most recent handoff for that ticket: `/resume_handoff ENG-XXXX`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Read and Analyze Handoff\n\n1. **Read handoff document completely**:\n   - Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters\n   - Extract all sections:\n     - Task(s) and their statuses\n     - Recent changes\n     - Learnings\n     - Artifacts\n     - Action items and next steps\n     - Other notes\n\n2. **Spawn focused research tasks**:\n   Based on the handoff content, spawn parallel research tasks to verify current state:\n\n   ```\n   Task 1 - Gather artifact context:\n   Read all artifacts mentioned in the handoff.\n   1. Read feature documents listed in \"Artifacts\"\n   2. Read implementation plans referenced\n   3. Read any research documents mentioned\n   4. Extract key requirements and decisions\n   Use tools: Read\n   Return: Summary of artifact contents and key decisions\n   ```\n\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n4. **Read critical files identified**:\n   - Read files from \"Learnings\" section completely\n   - Read files from \"Recent changes\" to understand modifications\n   - Read any new related files discovered during research\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize and Present Analysis\n\n1. **Present comprehensive analysis**:\n   ```\n   I've analyzed the handoff from [date] by [researcher]. Here's the current situation:\n\n   **Original Tasks:**\n   - [Task 1]: [Status from handoff] → [Current verification]\n   - [Task 2]: [Status from handoff] → [Current verification]\n\n   **Key Learnings Validated:**\n   - [Learning with file:line reference] - [Still valid/Changed]\n   - [Pattern discovered] - [Still applicable/Modified]\n\n   **Recent Changes Status:**\n   - [Change 1] - [Verified present/Missing/Modified]\n   - [Change 2] - [Verified present/Missing/Modified]\n\n   **Artifacts Reviewed:**\n   - [Document 1]: [Key takeaway]\n   - [Document 2]: [Key takeaway]\n\n   **Recommended Next Actions:**\n   Based on the handoff's action items and current state:\n   1. [Most logical next step based on handoff]\n   2. [Second priority action]\n   3. [Additional tasks discovered]\n\n   **Potential Issues Identified:**\n   - [Any conflicts or regressions found]\n   - [Missing dependencies or broken code]\n\n   Shall I proceed with [recommended action 1], or would you like to adjust the approach?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get confirmation** before proceeding\n\n### Step 3: Create Action Plan\n\n1. **Use TodoWrite to create task list**:\n   - Convert action items from handoff into todos\n   - Add any new tasks discovered during analysis\n   - Prioritize based on dependencies and handoff guidance\n\n2. **Present the plan**:\n   ```\n   I've created a task list based on the handoff and current analysis:\n\n   [Show todo list]\n\n   Ready to begin with the first task: [task description]?\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Begin Implementation\n\n1. **Start with the first approved task**\n2. **Reference learnings from handoff** throughout implementation\n3. **Apply patterns and approaches documented** in the handoff\n4. **Update progress** as tasks are completed\n\n## Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Thorough in Analysis**:\n   - Read the entire handoff document first\n   - Verify ALL mentioned changes still exist\n   - Check for any regressions or conflicts\n   - Read all referenced artifacts\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Present findings before starting work\n   - Get buy-in on the approach\n   - Allow for course corrections\n   - Adapt based on current state vs handoff state\n\n3. **Leverage Handoff Wisdom**:\n   - Pay special attention to \"Learnings\" section\n   - Apply documented patterns and approaches\n   - Avoid repeating mistakes mentioned\n   - Build on discovered solutions\n\n4. **Track Continuity**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to maintain task continuity\n   - Reference the handoff document in commits\n   - Document any deviations from original plan\n   - Consider creating a new handoff when done\n\n5. **Validate Before Acting**:\n   - Never assume handoff state matches current state\n   - Verify all file references still exist\n   - Check for breaking changes since handoff\n   - Confirm patterns are still valid\n\n## Common Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Clean Continuation\n- All changes from handoff are present\n- No conflicts or regressions\n- Clear next steps in action items\n- Proceed with recommended actions\n\n### Scenario 2: Diverged Codebase\n- Some changes missing or modified\n- New related code added since handoff\n- Need to reconcile differences\n- Adapt plan based on current state\n\n### Scenario 3: Incomplete Handoff Work\n- Tasks marked as \"in_progress\" in handoff\n- Need to complete unfinished work first\n- May need to re-understand partial implementations\n- Focus on completing before new work\n\n### Scenario 4: Stale Handoff\n- Significant time has passed\n- Major refactoring has occurred\n- Original approach may no longer apply\n- Need to re-evaluate strategy\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /resume_handoff specification/feature/handoffs/handoff-0.md\nAssistant: Let me read and analyze that handoff document...\n\n[Reads handoff completely]\n[Spawns research tasks]\n[Waits for completion]\n[Reads identified files]\n\nI've analyzed the handoff from [date]. Here's the current situation...\n\n[Presents analysis]\n\nShall I proceed with implementing the webhook validation fix, or would you like to adjust the approach?\n\nUser: Yes, proceed with the webhook validation\nAssistant: [Creates todo list and begins implementation]\n```\n\n\nARGUMENTS: thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-12-26_04-02-07_landing-page-redesign.md"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"7c2772cf-34fe-44d6-bc00-7c886269c4e8","timestamp":"2025-12-26T04:04:47.906Z","sourceToolUseID":"toolu_01RrmpjMdifaKEMgNkSKqY4h"}

The goal is to create a cohesive, polished experience that combines the current Swiss-style aesthetic with modern tech landing page patterns.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Issues Identified:\n1. **Navbar Animation** (`Header.tsx:30-39`): Jerky animation because height/width/maxWidth animate separately with different timings\n2. **RippleGrid** (`RippleGrid.tsx:66-68`): Only changes border color on hover, not tile fill; clickable area feels small\n3. **TeamCredentialsSection**: Scroll speed too fast (`speed={40}`)\n4. **FlowSection** (`FlowSection.tsx:327-329`): Logo wrapped in black box div instead of using SVG directly\n5. **Section Duplication**: \"Connect your tools\" and \"From Chaos to Clarity\" sections feel redundant\n6. **IntegrationsSection**: Uses text labels instead of company icons; missing Entourage logo in center\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- InfiniteSlider component at `src/components/ui/InfiniteSlider.tsx` handles scroll animations\n- Icon component at `src/components/Icon.tsx` wraps Iconify - can use company logos from `simple-icons:*`\n- Plus-corner card pattern already implemented in FlowSection and DataFolderSection\n- CSS animations for circuit signals defined in `globals.css:140-199`\n\n## Desired End State\n\n- Smooth, professional navbar animation without visible jerking\n- RippleGrid tiles change background color on hover with larger clickable targets\n- Team credentials scroll at comfortable reading pace\n- FlowSection displays proper SVG Entourage logo\n- Single unified BentoFeatures section combining: Integrations, Data Vault, Never Miss Task, Human-in-the-Loop\n- FAQ accordion at bottom before CTA\n- Section order: Hero → Credentials → How it works → Features (bento) → FAQ → CTA → Footer\n\n### Verification:\n- Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- No TypeScript errors: `pnpm typecheck`\n- Visual inspection confirms all animations are smooth\n- All bento cards display correctly on mobile and desktop\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not changing the overall design language (still Swiss-style with tech aesthetic)\n- Not modifying the Hero section content (only RippleGrid background)\n- Not adding new integrations beyond the specified list\n- Not changing the color palette (keeping single green accent)\n- Not adding rounded corners anywhere\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Fix Navbar Animation\n\n### Overview\nRemove jerky shrink/expand behavior by unifying animation timing and using CSS transforms instead of animating width/height separately.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update Header Animation Logic\n**File**: `src/components/Header.tsx`\n**Changes**: Simplify animation to use scale transform and unified timing\n\n```tsx\n// Replace the animate prop (lines 30-34) with:\nanimate={{\n  scale: isScrolled ? 0.85 : 1,\n}}\ntransition={{\n  duration: 0.3,\n  ease: [0.32, 0.72, 0, 1],\n}}\n\n// Update the className to handle border visibility:\nclassName={cn(\n  \"flex items-center justify-between px-4 h-14\",\n  \"transition-all duration-300 ease-out\",\n  isScrolled\n    ? \"bg-white/95 dark:bg-black/95 backdrop-blur-md border border-black dark:border-white\"\n    : \"bg-white dark:bg-black border border-transparent\"\n)}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- [x] TypeScript check passes: `pnpm typecheck`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Navbar shrinks smoothly in one motion when scrolling down\n- [ ] No visible \"expand then shrink\" or \"shrink then expand\" behavior\n- [ ] Border appears smoothly when scrolled\n- [ ] Works correctly in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause for manual confirmation.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Fix RippleGrid Interaction\n\n### Overview\nUpdate RippleGrid so tiles change background color on hover (not just borders) and increase the clickable/hoverable area.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update RippleGrid Hover Styles\n**File**: `src/components/RippleGrid.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add background color change on hover, increase cell size\n\n```tsx\n// Update lines 17-18 (increase cell size for larger clickable area)\nconst cellSize = 56; // was 48\n\n// Update className at line 65-68:\nclassName={cn(\n  \"border border-zinc-200/50 dark:border-zinc-800/50 transition-all duration-150\",\n  \"hover:bg-zinc-100/80 dark:hover:bg-zinc-900/80\",\n  \"hover:border-zinc-300 dark:hover:border-zinc-700\",\n  rippleCenter && \"animate-cell-ripple dark:animate-cell-ripple-dark\"\n)}\n```\n\n#### 2. Update Ripple Animation in globals.css\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n**Changes**: Update keyframes to animate background more prominently\n\n```css\n/* Update cell-ripple keyframes (lines 102-115) */\n@keyframes cell-ripple {\n  0% {\n    background-color: transparent;\n    border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);\n    border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\n  }\n  100% {\n    background-color: transparent;\n    border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Hovering over tiles shows visible background color change\n- [ ] Clicking anywhere on the grid triggers ripple effect\n- [ ] Hero title is visible above the grid\n- [ ] Grid fades smoothly at edges\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, pause for manual confirmation.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Slow TeamCredentialsSection Scroll\n\n### Overview\nReduce scroll speed from 40 to 20 for comfortable reading.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update InfiniteSlider Speed\n**File**: `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx`\n**Changes**: Reduce speed parameter\n\n```tsx\n// Update speed prop (around line with InfiniteSlider)\n<InfiniteSlider gap={48} reverse speed={20} speedOnHover={10}>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Credentials scroll at readable pace\n- [ ] Hover slowdown is noticeable but not jarring\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Fix FlowSection Logo\n\n### Overview\nReplace black box with logo background with proper SVG logo display.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update Center Logo Display\n**File**: `src/components/FlowSection.tsx`\n**Changes**: Remove black background wrapper, use logo directly\n\n```tsx\n// Replace lines 326-329 with:\n<div className=\"relative z-10 flex flex-col items-center\">\n  <LogoMark size={48} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n  <span className=\"mt-3 text-sm font-semibold text-black dark:text-white\">\n    Entourage\n  </span>\n  ...\n</div>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Entourage logo displays as SVG (not black box)\n- [ ] Logo visible in both light and dark mode\n- [ ] Pulse animation rings display correctly around logo\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Add Company Icons to Integrations\n\n### Overview\nReplace text labels in IntegrationsSection with Iconify company icons. Add Entourage logo to center.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update IntegrationsSection with Icons\n**File**: `src/components/IntegrationsSection.tsx`\n**Changes**: Replace text badges with icon badges, add Entourage logo in center\n\nCompany icons to use (from `simple-icons:*` in Iconify):\n- Linear: `simple-icons:linear`\n- Slack: `simple-icons:slack`\n- Calendar: `simple-icons:googlecalendar`\n- Email: `lucide:mail` (no simple-icons equivalent)\n- WhatsApp: `simple-icons:whatsapp`\n- Notion: `simple-icons:notion`\n- Granola: `lucide:wheat` (no simple-icons, use food icon)\n\n```tsx\n// Add Icon import at top\nimport { Icon } from \"./Icon\";\nimport { LogoMark, LogoFull } from \"./Logo\";\n\n// Replace each text-based badge with icon version:\n<g>\n  <rect ... />\n  <foreignObject x=\"35\" y=\"10\" width=\"50\" height=\"20\">\n    <div className=\"w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center\">\n      <Icon icon=\"simple-icons:linear\" size={12} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n    </div>\n  </foreignObject>\n</g>\n\n// Update center Entourage node to use LogoMark:\n<g>\n  <rect x=\"170\" y=\"90\" width=\"60\" height=\"20\" className=\"fill-black dark:fill-white\" />\n  <foreignObject x=\"170\" y=\"90\" width=\"60\" height=\"20\">\n    <div className=\"w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center gap-1\">\n      <LogoMark size={12} className=\"text-white dark:text-black\" />\n      <span className=\"text-[7px] font-semibold text-white dark:text-black\">ENTOURAGE</span>\n    </div>\n  </foreignObject>\n</g>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] All integration badges show company icons\n- [ ] Center node shows Entourage logo with text\n- [ ] Icons are visible in both light and dark mode\n\n---\n\n## Phase 6: Create BentoFeatures Section\n\n### Overview\nCreate a unified bento grid section combining: Integrations visualization, Data Vault, Never Miss a Task, and Human-in-the-Loop. This replaces separate IntegrationsSection, DataFolderSection, and ValueProps.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create BentoFeatures Component\n**File**: `src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx` (new file)\n**Changes**: Create bento grid layout with 4 feature cards\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { motion, useReducedMotion } from \"framer-motion\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport { Container } from \"./ui/Container\";\nimport { Icon } from \"./Icon\";\nimport { LogoMark } from \"./Logo\";\n\n// Bento grid with 4 cards:\n// - Large card (2x2): Integrations visualization (circuit board mini)\n// - Tall card (1x2): Data Vault (folder animation)\n// - Wide card (2x1): Never Miss a Task\n// - Square card (1x1): Human in the Loop\n\n// Layout on desktop (4 cols):\n// [Integrations 2x2] [DataVault 1x2] [HumanLoop 1x1]\n// [Integrations    ] [DataVault    ] [NeverMiss 2x1]\n\n// Mobile: Stack vertically\n```\n\n#### 2. Create PlusCornerCard Subcomponent\nExtract plus-corner card pattern as reusable component for bento cards.\n\n```tsx\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCornerCard({ children, className, dashed = true }: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className={cn(\n      \"relative\",\n      dashed ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\" : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n      \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n      className\n    )}>\n      {/* Plus corners SVGs */}\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Individual Bento Cards\n\n**IntegrationsCard**: Simplified circuit board showing icons flowing to center\n**DataVaultCard**: Folder hover animation (extracted from DataFolderSection)\n**NeverMissCard**: Icon + title + description\n**HumanLoopCard**: Icon + title + description\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] No TypeScript errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Bento grid displays correctly on desktop (4-column layout)\n- [ ] Bento grid stacks properly on mobile\n- [ ] Integrations card shows circuit animation\n- [ ] Data vault folder opens on hover\n- [ ] All cards have plus-corner styling\n\n**Implementation Note**: This is the largest phase. Pause for manual confirmation before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 7: Create FAQ Accordion\n\n### Overview\nCreate a simple FAQ accordion component using shadcn/ui accordion primitive.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Install ShadCN Accordion\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add accordion\n```\n\n#### 2. Create FAQ Component\n**File**: `src/components/FAQ.tsx` (new file)\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { Container } from \"./ui/Container\";\nimport {\n  Accordion,\n  AccordionContent,\n  AccordionItem,\n  AccordionTrigger,\n} from \"@/components/ui/accordion\";\n\nconst faqs = [\n  {\n    question: \"How does Entourage extract tasks from my communications?\",\n    answer: \"Entourage uses AI to analyze your meetings, messages, and emails to identify action items, deadlines, and commitments.

Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser\n2. Scroll down slowly and verify navbar animation is smooth\n3. Hover over RippleGrid tiles and verify background color changes\n4. Scroll to credentials section and verify readable speed\n5. Verify FlowSection shows SVG logo (not black box)\n6. Verify BentoFeatures grid layout on desktop and mobile\n7. Expand/collapse FAQ items\n8. Test in dark mode\n9. Test on mobile viewport\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- BentoFeatures section may have multiple animations - ensure `useReducedMotion` is respected\n- Circuit board SVG animations should use CSS `offset-path` (already implemented)\n- Folder animation uses inline styles for transforms - acceptable for hover states\n\n## References\n\n- Original handoff: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-12-25_16-30-54_design-system-flowdiagram-improvements.md`\n- Design guide: `entourage_design_guide.md`\n- ShadCN components: `src/components/ui/`\n- Iconify usage: `src/components/Icon.tsx`\n","numLines":546,"startLine":1,"totalLines":546}}}

The SVG approach has these problems:\n1. Font size is 5 (very small)\n2. Rectangle badges are 42x12 pixels in SVG units - tiny\n3. On mobile the SVG scales down making text even smaller\n\nI should convert the input badges from SVG elements to actual HTML/Tailwind elements. This will:\n1. Make them much more readable\n2. Allow proper responsive text sizing\n3. Give better control over mobile layout (can stack or wrap)\n\nI'll refactor to:\n1. Use HTML badges above the SVG paths\n2. Keep the SVG just for the connecting lines\n3. Make badges responsive - maybe 2x2 grid on mobile\n\nLet me rewrite this section.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5445,"cache_read_input_tokens":65250,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5445,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWUeSmzgb2FufA9LzPE8L","type":"assistant","uuid":"d2ec7465-6b73-4e18-ad23-e2f485091b75","timestamp":"2025-12-26T04:12:28.393Z"}

Let me think about what might be wrong:\n\n1. I changed the input badges from SVG text to HTML divs\n2. The connecting lines SVG paths might not be aligned properly with the new HTML badges\n3. The viewBox and path coordinates might not match the new layout\n\nThe problem is the SVG lines are trying to connect from specific x-coordinates (50, 150, 250, 350) to the center, but the HTML badges are in a CSS grid layout that doesn't align with those coordinates.\n\nOptions:\n1. Remove the connecting lines entirely for a cleaner look\n2. Simplify to just use vertical lines from badges to the box\n3. Use a simple downward arrow flow instead of complex paths\n\nLet me simplify - instead of trying to match SVG paths to HTML elements, I'll use a simpler visual approach with dashed lines going down to a center point.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2154,"cache_read_input_tokens":79661,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2154,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWUeY7x88aR1LRre59AqW","type":"assistant","uuid":"13288715-5820-46cb-bf96-d13a80c564f0","timestamp":"2025-12-26T04:13:40.516Z"}

The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. **Initial Request - Resume Handoff**\n   - User invoked `/resume_handoff thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-12-26_04-02-07_landing-page-redesign.md`\n   - I read the handoff document which described an 8-phase landing page redesign\n   - Phases 1-4 were marked complete (Navbar animation, RippleGrid, TeamCredentialsSection scroll, FlowSection logo)\n   - Phases 5-8 were pending (Company icons, BentoFeatures, FAQ, Section reorder)\n\n2. **User Feedback on RippleGrid**\n   - User said Phase 2 RippleGrid animation \"is still not working; it doesn't really seem to work well\"\n   - Requested: \"Use the dashed lines and very thin lines with the plus signs in the corners\"\n   - Key instruction: \"very smooth-looking minimal UX\", \"emphasizes readability\", \"anything that would mess with the readability or anything is off the limits\"\n   - Requested: \"delete the other grid background thing elements completely from the project\"\n\n3. **My Initial Fix Attempt**\n   - Created `HeroBackground.tsx` - a centered dashed rectangle with plus corners and center crosshair\n   - Updated `Hero.tsx` to import HeroBackground instead of RippleGrid\n   - Deleted `RippleGrid.tsx`\n   - Removed cell-ripple CSS animations from `globals.css`\n\n4. **User Feedback on HeroBackground**\n   - User said \"The changes you just made don't really work too well\"\n   - Requested: \"corner + signs could be bigger and with the same kind of style that is used in the flow chart\"\n   - Suggested: \"More like do the boxes around the different texts or something like this could be better\"\n   - Key instruction: \"Just something smooth and clean. It can be very simple.\"\n\n5. **My Second Fix**\n   - Deleted `HeroBackground.tsx`\n   - Rewrote `Hero.tsx` to embed plus corners directly around the content wrapper\n   - Used same plus corner style as FlowSection (w-5 h-5, strokeWidth=\"1\")\n   - Added dashed border around content area\n\n6. **User Feedback on FlowSection Readability**\n   - User said: \"The meeting, e-messages, e-mails, documents there. I don't think they're very easily readable, especially on mobile\"\n   - Requested: \"increase the readability and probably the size of the element too\"\n   - Requested: \"make sure that on mobile it doesn't overflow or anything. It should look smooth.\"\n\n7. **My FlowSection Fix - First Attempt**\n   - Converted input badges from SVG text to HTML elements\n   - Added icons to each badge\n   - Made responsive grid (2 columns mobile, 4 columns desktop)\n   - Kept the complex SVG connecting lines\n\n8. **User Feedback - Broken Flowchart**\n   - User said: \"Now the flow chart part looks totally broken\"\n   - Then added: \"Also on desktop\"\n\n9. **My FlowSection Fix - Second Attempt**\n   - Removed complex SVG connecting paths\n   - Simplified to single dashed line + arrow between badges and processing box\n   - Increased badge sizes further:\n     - Icon size: 14px → 18px\n     - Text: text-xs → text-sm md:text-base\n     - Padding: increased\n     - Max width: max-w-lg → max-w-2xl\n\nFiles modified/created/deleted:\n- Created then deleted: `src/components/HeroBackground.tsx`\n- Modified: `src/components/Hero.tsx`\n- Deleted: `src/components/RippleGrid.tsx`\n- Modified: `src/app/globals.css` (removed cell-ripple animations)\n- Modified: `src/components/FlowSection.tsx`\n\nKey patterns used:\n- Plus corner SVG pattern from FlowSection\n- Dashed borders for visual framing\n- Responsive grid layouts\n- HTML badges instead of SVG text for better readability\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Resume work from a landing page redesign handoff document\n   - Phases 1-4 were already complete, phases 5-8 pending\n   - User rejected Phase 2 RippleGrid implementation - wanted it replaced with a minimal design using dashed lines and plus corners\n   - User wanted better readability for FlowSection input badges (Meetings, Messages, Emails, Documents), especially on mobile\n   - Overall goal: Clean, minimal, readable design matching the Swiss-style aesthetic with plus-corner patterns\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Plus corner SVG pattern: `<path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />` with `w-5 h-5`, `strokeWidth=\"1\"`, `text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600`\n   - Dashed borders: `border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800`\n   - Responsive grids: `grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4`\n   - Font system: Switzer for UI text, Geist Mono for code/data highlights\n   - HTML badges instead of SVG text for better mobile readability\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`src/components/Hero.tsx`** (Final version)\n     - Replaced RippleGrid with inline plus-corner box around content\n     - Important for consistent design language\n     ```tsx\n     \"use client\";\n\n     import Link from \"next/link\";\n     import { motion, useReducedMotion } from \"framer-motion\";\n     import { Container } from \"./ui/Container\";\n     import { Button } from \"./ui/Button\";\n\n     // Plus corner SVG component for consistency with FlowSection\n     function PlusCorner({ className }: { className?: string }) {\n       return (\n         <svg\n           className={className}\n           viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n           fill=\"none\"\n           stroke=\"currentColor\"\n           strokeWidth=\"1\"\n         >\n           <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n         </svg>\n       );\n     }\n\n     export function Hero() {\n       const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();\n\n       const fadeUp = (delay: number) => ({\n         initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n         animate: {\n           opacity: 1,\n           y: 0,\n           transition: {\n             duration: 0.15,\n             delay: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : delay,\n             ease: \"easeOut\" as const,\n           },\n         },\n       });\n\n       return (\n         <section className=\"relative pt-28 pb-16 sm:pt-32 sm:pb-24 md:pt-40 md:pb-32\">\n           <Container>\n             {/* Content wrapper with plus corners */}\n             <div className=\"relative mx-auto max-w-3xl px-6 py-12 md:px-12 md:py-16\">\n               {/* Dashed border */}\n               <div className=\"absolute inset-0 border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800\" />\n\n               {/* Plus corners - matching FlowSection style */}\n               <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n               <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n               <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n               <PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n\n               {/* Content */}\n               <div className=\"relative text-center\">\n                 <motion.h1\n                   {...fadeUp(0)}\n                   className=\"text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-black dark:text-white sm:text-4xl md:text-6xl\"\n                 >\n                   Know what needs to be done.\n                 </motion.h1>\n                 {/* ... rest of hero content */}\n               </div>\n             </div>\n           </Container>\n         </section>\n       );\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/components/FlowSection.tsx`** (Final version - input badges section)\n     - Converted from SVG text to HTML for better readability\n     - Simplified connecting lines from complex SVG paths to single dashed line\n     ```tsx\n     const inputSources = [\n       { label: \"Meetings\", icon: \"lucide:calendar\" },\n       { label: \"Messages\", icon: \"lucide:message-square\" },\n       { label: \"Emails\", icon: \"lucide:mail\" },\n       { label: \"Documents\", icon: \"lucide:file-text\" },\n     ];\n\n     // In component:\n     <div className=\"relative flex flex-col items-center max-w-2xl mx-auto\">\n       {/* Input source badges */}\n       <div className=\"grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-3 md:gap-4 w-full max-w-2xl\">\n         {inputSources.map((source) => (\n           <div\n             key={source.label}\n             className=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-2.5 px-4 py-3 md:px-5 md:py-3.5 border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700 bg-white dark:bg-black\"\n           >\n             <Icon\n               icon={source.icon}\n               size={18}\n               className=\"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400\"\n             />\n             <span className=\"text-sm md:text-base font-mono text-black dark:text-white\">\n               {source.label}\n             </span>\n           </div>\n         ))}\n       </div>\n\n       {/* Simple connecting line */}\n       <div className=\"flex flex-col items-center py-4\">\n         <div className=\"h-6 w-px border-l border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\" />\n         <div className=\"text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600 text-xs\">▼</div>\n       </div>\n       {/* ... rest of FlowSection */}\n     </div>\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/components/RippleGrid.tsx`** - DELETED\n   \n   - **`src/components/HeroBackground.tsx`** - Created then DELETED (first attempt that user rejected)\n   \n   - **`src/app/globals.css`** - Removed cell-ripple animations (lines 101-138)\n\n4. Errors and Fixes:\n   - **First HeroBackground attempt rejected**: User said \"The changes you just made don't really work too well\" - wanted bigger plus signs matching FlowSection style and simpler approach\n     - Fix: Deleted HeroBackground.tsx, embedded plus corners directly in Hero.tsx using same pattern as FlowSection\n   \n   - **FlowSection broken after badge conversion**: When I converted SVG text badges to HTML, the complex SVG connecting paths no longer aligned\n     - User feedback: \"Now the flow chart part looks totally broken\"\n     - Fix: Removed complex SVG paths entirely, replaced with simple dashed line + arrow\n\n   - **Readability on desktop**: User said \"Also on desktop\" implying badges still too small\n     - Fix: Increased icon size (14→18px), text size (text-xs→text-sm md:text-base), padding, and max-width\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Solved: RippleGrid replacement with minimal plus-corner design\n   - Solved: FlowSection input badge readability on mobile/desktop\n   - Solved: Broken flowchart after HTML badge conversion (simplified connecting lines)\n\n6. All User Messages:\n   - \"The Phase 2 RippleGrid animation is still not working; it doesn't really seem to work well. Use the dashed lines and very thin lines with the plus signs in the corners, and do something like that to the hero section. I suggest a very smooth-looking minimal UX for it, which emphasizes that the main thing is to just make it very understandable. The hero section of what we are doing. So, anything that would mess with the readability or anything is off the limits. Yeah, and then delete the other grid background thing elements completely from the project.\"\n   - \"Also in the theme background section, yeah, use maybe the corner + signs could be bigger and with the same kind of style that is used in the flow chart. To make everything more uniform. The changes you just made don't really work too well. More like do the boxes around the different texts or something like this could be better. Just something smooth and clean. It can be very simple.\"\n   - \"The meeting, e-messages, e-mails, documents there. I don't think they're very easily readable, especially on mobile. You should increase the readability and probably the size of the element too. Then look that it makes sure that on mobile it doesn't overflow or anything. It should look smooth.\"\n   - (System reminder) \"And make sure that in the hero section you are using the correct font. A switzer and then use the geist mono for some highlights.\"\n   - (System reminder) \"Now the flow chart part looks totally broken.\"\n   - (System reminder) \"Also on desktop.\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Phase 5: Add company icons to IntegrationsSection\n   - Phase 6: Create BentoFeatures section\n   - Phase 7: Create FAQ Accordion\n   - Phase 8: Reorder page sections\n   - Hero font verification (Switzer for main text, Geist Mono for highlights) - mentioned in system reminder\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Immediately before summary request, I was improving FlowSection input badge readability. Final changes:\n   - Increased icon size from 14 to 18px\n   - Increased text from `text-xs sm:text-sm` to `text-sm md:text-base`\n   - Increased padding\n   - Changed grid breakpoint from `sm:` to `md:` for better mobile layout\n   - Increased max-width from `max-w-lg` to `max-w-2xl`\n   - Build verified passing\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   User should preview the changes with `pnpm dev` to verify the FlowSection badges are now readable on both mobile and desktop. If approved, continue with Phase 5 (adding company icons to IntegrationsSection) or verify Hero fonts are using Switzer/Geist Mono correctly as mentioned in system reminder.."},"isVisibleInTranscriptOnly":true,"isCompactSummary":true,"uuid":"109e5d2b-93a2-43a4-a0bb-f12e74ecc9c8","timestamp":"2025-12-26T04:18:54.568Z"}

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n- **Pause for human verification**: After completing all automated verification for a phase, pause and inform the human that the phase is ready for manual testing. Use this format:\n  ```\n  Phase [N] Complete - Ready for Manual Verification\n\n  Automated verification passed:\n  - [List automated checks that passed]\n\n  Please perform the manual verification steps listed in the plan:\n  - [List manual verification items from the plan]\n\n  Let me know when manual testing is complete so I can proceed to Phase [N+1].\n  ```\n\nIf instructed to execute multiple phases consecutively, skip the pause until the last phase. Otherwise, assume you are just doing one phase.\n\ndo not check off items in the manual testing steps until confirmed by the user.\n\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n\n\nARGUMENTS: phase 5"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"7ab25121-7794-4db9-b2ab-bf331c41fd8e","timestamp":"2025-12-26T04:18:54.627Z"}

The goal is to create a cohesive, polished experience that combines the current Swiss-style aesthetic with modern tech landing page patterns.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Issues Identified:\n1. **Navbar Animation** (`Header.tsx:30-39`): Jerky animation because height/width/maxWidth animate separately with different timings\n2. **RippleGrid** (`RippleGrid.tsx:66-68`): Only changes border color on hover, not tile fill; clickable area feels small\n3. **TeamCredentialsSection**: Scroll speed too fast (`speed={40}`)\n4. **FlowSection** (`FlowSection.tsx:327-329`): Logo wrapped in black box div instead of using SVG directly\n5. **Section Duplication**: \"Connect your tools\" and \"From Chaos to Clarity\" sections feel redundant\n6. **IntegrationsSection**: Uses text labels instead of company icons; missing Entourage logo in center\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- InfiniteSlider component at `src/components/ui/InfiniteSlider.tsx` handles scroll animations\n- Icon component at `src/components/Icon.tsx` wraps Iconify - can use company logos from `simple-icons:*`\n- Plus-corner card pattern already implemented in FlowSection and DataFolderSection\n- CSS animations for circuit signals defined in `globals.css:140-199`\n\n## Desired End State\n\n- Smooth, professional navbar animation without visible jerking\n- RippleGrid tiles change background color on hover with larger clickable targets\n- Team credentials scroll at comfortable reading pace\n- FlowSection displays proper SVG Entourage logo\n- Single unified BentoFeatures section combining: Integrations, Data Vault, Never Miss Task, Human-in-the-Loop\n- FAQ accordion at bottom before CTA\n- Section order: Hero → Credentials → How it works → Features (bento) → FAQ → CTA → Footer\n\n### Verification:\n- Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- No TypeScript errors: `pnpm typecheck`\n- Visual inspection confirms all animations are smooth\n- All bento cards display correctly on mobile and desktop\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not changing the overall design language (still Swiss-style with tech aesthetic)\n- Not modifying the Hero section content (only RippleGrid background)\n- Not adding new integrations beyond the specified list\n- Not changing the color palette (keeping single green accent)\n- Not adding rounded corners anywhere\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Fix Navbar Animation\n\n### Overview\nRemove jerky shrink/expand behavior by unifying animation timing and using CSS transforms instead of animating width/height separately.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update Header Animation Logic\n**File**: `src/components/Header.tsx`\n**Changes**: Simplify animation to use scale transform and unified timing\n\n```tsx\n// Replace the animate prop (lines 30-34) with:\nanimate={{\n  scale: isScrolled ? 0.85 : 1,\n}}\ntransition={{\n  duration: 0.3,\n  ease: [0.32, 0.72, 0, 1],\n}}\n\n// Update the className to handle border visibility:\nclassName={cn(\n  \"flex items-center justify-between px-4 h-14\",\n  \"transition-all duration-300 ease-out\",\n  isScrolled\n    ? \"bg-white/95 dark:bg-black/95 backdrop-blur-md border border-black dark:border-white\"\n    : \"bg-white dark:bg-black border border-transparent\"\n)}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- [x] TypeScript check passes: `pnpm typecheck`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Navbar shrinks smoothly in one motion when scrolling down\n- [ ] No visible \"expand then shrink\" or \"shrink then expand\" behavior\n- [ ] Border appears smoothly when scrolled\n- [ ] Works correctly in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause for manual confirmation.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Fix RippleGrid Interaction\n\n### Overview\nUpdate RippleGrid so tiles change background color on hover (not just borders) and increase the clickable/hoverable area.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update RippleGrid Hover Styles\n**File**: `src/components/RippleGrid.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add background color change on hover, increase cell size\n\n```tsx\n// Update lines 17-18 (increase cell size for larger clickable area)\nconst cellSize = 56; // was 48\n\n// Update className at line 65-68:\nclassName={cn(\n  \"border border-zinc-200/50 dark:border-zinc-800/50 transition-all duration-150\",\n  \"hover:bg-zinc-100/80 dark:hover:bg-zinc-900/80\",\n  \"hover:border-zinc-300 dark:hover:border-zinc-700\",\n  rippleCenter && \"animate-cell-ripple dark:animate-cell-ripple-dark\"\n)}\n```\n\n#### 2. Update Ripple Animation in globals.css\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n**Changes**: Update keyframes to animate background more prominently\n\n```css\n/* Update cell-ripple keyframes (lines 102-115) */\n@keyframes cell-ripple {\n  0% {\n    background-color: transparent;\n    border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);\n    border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\n  }\n  100% {\n    background-color: transparent;\n    border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Hovering over tiles shows visible background color change\n- [ ] Clicking anywhere on the grid triggers ripple effect\n- [ ] Hero title is visible above the grid\n- [ ] Grid fades smoothly at edges\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, pause for manual confirmation.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Slow TeamCredentialsSection Scroll\n\n### Overview\nReduce scroll speed from 40 to 20 for comfortable reading.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update InfiniteSlider Speed\n**File**: `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx`\n**Changes**: Reduce speed parameter\n\n```tsx\n// Update speed prop (around line with InfiniteSlider)\n<InfiniteSlider gap={48} reverse speed={20} speedOnHover={10}>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Credentials scroll at readable pace\n- [ ] Hover slowdown is noticeable but not jarring\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Fix FlowSection Logo\n\n### Overview\nReplace black box with logo background with proper SVG logo display.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update Center Logo Display\n**File**: `src/components/FlowSection.tsx`\n**Changes**: Remove black background wrapper, use logo directly\n\n```tsx\n// Replace lines 326-329 with:\n<div className=\"relative z-10 flex flex-col items-center\">\n  <LogoMark size={48} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n  <span className=\"mt-3 text-sm font-semibold text-black dark:text-white\">\n    Entourage\n  </span>\n  ...\n</div>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Entourage logo displays as SVG (not black box)\n- [ ] Logo visible in both light and dark mode\n- [ ] Pulse animation rings display correctly around logo\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Add Company Icons to Integrations\n\n### Overview\nReplace text labels in IntegrationsSection with Iconify company icons. Add Entourage logo to center.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update IntegrationsSection with Icons\n**File**: `src/components/IntegrationsSection.tsx`\n**Changes**: Replace text badges with icon badges, add Entourage logo in center\n\nCompany icons to use (from `simple-icons:*` in Iconify):\n- Linear: `simple-icons:linear`\n- Slack: `simple-icons:slack`\n- Calendar: `simple-icons:googlecalendar`\n- Email: `lucide:mail` (no simple-icons equivalent)\n- WhatsApp: `simple-icons:whatsapp`\n- Notion: `simple-icons:notion`\n- Granola: `lucide:wheat` (no simple-icons, use food icon)\n\n```tsx\n// Add Icon import at top\nimport { Icon } from \"./Icon\";\nimport { LogoMark, LogoFull } from \"./Logo\";\n\n// Replace each text-based badge with icon version:\n<g>\n  <rect ... />\n  <foreignObject x=\"35\" y=\"10\" width=\"50\" height=\"20\">\n    <div className=\"w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center\">\n      <Icon icon=\"simple-icons:linear\" size={12} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n    </div>\n  </foreignObject>\n</g>\n\n// Update center Entourage node to use LogoMark:\n<g>\n  <rect x=\"170\" y=\"90\" width=\"60\" height=\"20\" className=\"fill-black dark:fill-white\" />\n  <foreignObject x=\"170\" y=\"90\" width=\"60\" height=\"20\">\n    <div className=\"w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center gap-1\">\n      <LogoMark size={12} className=\"text-white dark:text-black\" />\n      <span className=\"text-[7px] font-semibold text-white dark:text-black\">ENTOURAGE</span>\n    </div>\n  </foreignObject>\n</g>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] All integration badges show company icons\n- [ ] Center node shows Entourage logo with text\n- [ ] Icons are visible in both light and dark mode\n\n---\n\n## Phase 6: Create BentoFeatures Section\n\n### Overview\nCreate a unified bento grid section combining: Integrations visualization, Data Vault, Never Miss a Task, and Human-in-the-Loop. This replaces separate IntegrationsSection, DataFolderSection, and ValueProps.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create BentoFeatures Component\n**File**: `src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx` (new file)\n**Changes**: Create bento grid layout with 4 feature cards\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { motion, useReducedMotion } from \"framer-motion\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport { Container } from \"./ui/Container\";\nimport { Icon } from \"./Icon\";\nimport { LogoMark } from \"./Logo\";\n\n// Bento grid with 4 cards:\n// - Large card (2x2): Integrations visualization (circuit board mini)\n// - Tall card (1x2): Data Vault (folder animation)\n// - Wide card (2x1): Never Miss a Task\n// - Square card (1x1): Human in the Loop\n\n// Layout on desktop (4 cols):\n// [Integrations 2x2] [DataVault 1x2] [HumanLoop 1x1]\n// [Integrations    ] [DataVault    ] [NeverMiss 2x1]\n\n// Mobile: Stack vertically\n```\n\n#### 2. Create PlusCornerCard Subcomponent\nExtract plus-corner card pattern as reusable component for bento cards.\n\n```tsx\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCornerCard({ children, className, dashed = true }: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className={cn(\n      \"relative\",\n      dashed ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\" : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n      \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n      className\n    )}>\n      {/* Plus corners SVGs */}\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Individual Bento Cards\n\n**IntegrationsCard**: Simplified circuit board showing icons flowing to center\n**DataVaultCard**: Folder hover animation (extracted from DataFolderSection)\n**NeverMissCard**: Icon + title + description\n**HumanLoopCard**: Icon + title + description\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] No TypeScript errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Bento grid displays correctly on desktop (4-column layout)\n- [ ] Bento grid stacks properly on mobile\n- [ ] Integrations card shows circuit animation\n- [ ] Data vault folder opens on hover\n- [ ] All cards have plus-corner styling\n\n**Implementation Note**: This is the largest phase. Pause for manual confirmation before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 7: Create FAQ Accordion\n\n### Overview\nCreate a simple FAQ accordion component using shadcn/ui accordion primitive.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

Update Page Layout\n**File**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n**Changes**: Remove old sections, add new ones in correct order\n\n```tsx\nimport { Header } from \"@/components/Header\";\nimport { Hero } from \"@/components/Hero\";\nimport { TeamCredentialsSection } from \"@/components/TeamCredentialsSection\";\nimport { FlowSection } from \"@/components/FlowSection\";\nimport { BentoFeatures } from \"@/components/BentoFeatures\";\nimport { FAQ } from \"@/components/FAQ\";\nimport { SecondaryCTA } from \"@/components/SecondaryCTA\";\nimport { Footer } from \"@/components/Footer\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Header />\n      <main>\n        <Hero />\n        <TeamCredentialsSection />\n        <FlowSection />\n        <BentoFeatures />\n        <FAQ />\n        <SecondaryCTA />\n      </main>\n      <Footer />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Delete Deprecated Components (optional cleanup)\nCan delete or keep for reference:\n- `src/components/IntegrationsSection.tsx` (replaced by BentoFeatures)\n- `src/components/DataFolderSection.tsx` (merged into BentoFeatures)\n- `src/components/ValueProps.tsx` (merged into BentoFeatures)\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] No unused imports/exports\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Page loads without errors\n- [ ] Section order is: Hero → Credentials → How it works → Features → FAQ → CTA → Footer\n- [ ] Scroll flow feels natural\n- [ ] No duplicate content\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- None required for this visual redesign\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- None required for this visual redesign\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser\n2. Scroll down slowly and verify navbar animation is smooth\n3. Hover over RippleGrid tiles and verify background color changes\n4. Scroll to credentials section and verify readable speed\n5. Verify FlowSection shows SVG logo (not black box)\n6. Verify BentoFeatures grid layout on desktop and mobile\n7. Expand/collapse FAQ items\n8. Test in dark mode\n9. Test on mobile viewport\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- BentoFeatures section may have multiple animations - ensure `useReducedMotion` is respected\n- Circuit board SVG animations should use CSS `offset-path` (already implemented)\n- Folder animation uses inline styles for transforms - acceptable for hover states\n\n## References\n\n- Original handoff: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-12-25_16-30-54_design-system-flowdiagram-improvements.md`\n- Design guide: `entourage_design_guide.md`\n- ShadCN components: `src/components/ui/`\n- Iconify usage: `src/components/Icon.tsx`\n","numLines":546,"startLine":1,"totalLines":546}}}

The goal is to create a cohesive, polished experience that combines the current Swiss-style aesthetic with modern tech landing page patterns.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Issues Identified:\n1. **Navbar Animation** (`Header.tsx:30-39`): Jerky animation because height/width/maxWidth animate separately with different timings\n2. **RippleGrid** (`RippleGrid.tsx:66-68`): Only changes border color on hover, not tile fill; clickable area feels small\n3. **TeamCredentialsSection**: Scroll speed too fast (`speed={40}`)\n4. **FlowSection** (`FlowSection.tsx:327-329`): Logo wrapped in black box div instead of using SVG directly\n5. **Section Duplication**: \"Connect your tools\" and \"From Chaos to Clarity\" sections feel redundant\n6. **IntegrationsSection**: Uses text labels instead of company icons; missing Entourage logo in center\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- InfiniteSlider component at `src/components/ui/InfiniteSlider.tsx` handles scroll animations\n- Icon component at `src/components/Icon.tsx` wraps Iconify - can use company logos from `simple-icons:*`\n- Plus-corner card pattern already implemented in FlowSection and DataFolderSection\n- CSS animations for circuit signals defined in `globals.css:140-199`\n\n## Desired End State\n\n- Smooth, professional navbar animation without visible jerking\n- RippleGrid tiles change background color on hover with larger clickable targets\n- Team credentials scroll at comfortable reading pace\n- FlowSection displays proper SVG Entourage logo\n- Single unified BentoFeatures section combining: Integrations, Data Vault, Never Miss Task, Human-in-the-Loop\n- FAQ accordion at bottom before CTA\n- Section order: Hero → Credentials → How it works → Features (bento) → FAQ → CTA → Footer\n\n### Verification:\n- Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- No TypeScript errors: `pnpm typecheck`\n- Visual inspection confirms all animations are smooth\n- All bento cards display correctly on mobile and desktop\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not changing the overall design language (still Swiss-style with tech aesthetic)\n- Not modifying the Hero section content (only RippleGrid background)\n- Not adding new integrations beyond the specified list\n- Not changing the color palette (keeping single green accent)\n- Not adding rounded corners anywhere\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Fix Navbar Animation\n\n### Overview\nRemove jerky shrink/expand behavior by unifying animation timing and using CSS transforms instead of animating width/height separately.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update Header Animation Logic\n**File**: `src/components/Header.tsx`\n**Changes**: Simplify animation to use scale transform and unified timing\n\n```tsx\n// Replace the animate prop (lines 30-34) with:\nanimate={{\n  scale: isScrolled ? 0.85 : 1,\n}}\ntransition={{\n  duration: 0.3,\n  ease: [0.32, 0.72, 0, 1],\n}}\n\n// Update the className to handle border visibility:\nclassName={cn(\n  \"flex items-center justify-between px-4 h-14\",\n  \"transition-all duration-300 ease-out\",\n  isScrolled\n    ? \"bg-white/95 dark:bg-black/95 backdrop-blur-md border border-black dark:border-white\"\n    : \"bg-white dark:bg-black border border-transparent\"\n)}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- [x] TypeScript check passes: `pnpm typecheck`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Navbar shrinks smoothly in one motion when scrolling down\n- [ ] No visible \"expand then shrink\" or \"shrink then expand\" behavior\n- [ ] Border appears smoothly when scrolled\n- [ ] Works correctly in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause for manual confirmation.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Fix RippleGrid Interaction\n\n### Overview\nUpdate RippleGrid so tiles change background color on hover (not just borders) and increase the clickable/hoverable area.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update RippleGrid Hover Styles\n**File**: `src/components/RippleGrid.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add background color change on hover, increase cell size\n\n```tsx\n// Update lines 17-18 (increase cell size for larger clickable area)\nconst cellSize = 56; // was 48\n\n// Update className at line 65-68:\nclassName={cn(\n  \"border border-zinc-200/50 dark:border-zinc-800/50 transition-all duration-150\",\n  \"hover:bg-zinc-100/80 dark:hover:bg-zinc-900/80\",\n  \"hover:border-zinc-300 dark:hover:border-zinc-700\",\n  rippleCenter && \"animate-cell-ripple dark:animate-cell-ripple-dark\"\n)}\n```\n\n#### 2. Update Ripple Animation in globals.css\n**File**: `src/app/globals.css`\n**Changes**: Update keyframes to animate background more prominently\n\n```css\n/* Update cell-ripple keyframes (lines 102-115) */\n@keyframes cell-ripple {\n  0% {\n    background-color: transparent;\n    border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);\n    border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\n  }\n  100% {\n    background-color: transparent;\n    border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Hovering over tiles shows visible background color change\n- [ ] Clicking anywhere on the grid triggers ripple effect\n- [ ] Hero title is visible above the grid\n- [ ] Grid fades smoothly at edges\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, pause for manual confirmation.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Slow TeamCredentialsSection Scroll\n\n### Overview\nReduce scroll speed from 40 to 20 for comfortable reading.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update InfiniteSlider Speed\n**File**: `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx`\n**Changes**: Reduce speed parameter\n\n```tsx\n// Update speed prop (around line with InfiniteSlider)\n<InfiniteSlider gap={48} reverse speed={20} speedOnHover={10}>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Credentials scroll at readable pace\n- [ ] Hover slowdown is noticeable but not jarring\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Fix FlowSection Logo\n\n### Overview\nReplace black box with logo background with proper SVG logo display.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update Center Logo Display\n**File**: `src/components/FlowSection.tsx`\n**Changes**: Remove black background wrapper, use logo directly\n\n```tsx\n// Replace lines 326-329 with:\n<div className=\"relative z-10 flex flex-col items-center\">\n  <LogoMark size={48} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n  <span className=\"mt-3 text-sm font-semibold text-black dark:text-white\">\n    Entourage\n  </span>\n  ...\n</div>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Entourage logo displays as SVG (not black box)\n- [ ] Logo visible in both light and dark mode\n- [ ] Pulse animation rings display correctly around logo\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Add Company Icons to Integrations\n\n### Overview\nReplace text labels in IntegrationsSection with Iconify company icons. Add Entourage logo to center.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Update IntegrationsSection with Icons\n**File**: `src/components/IntegrationsSection.tsx`\n**Changes**: Replace text badges with icon badges, add Entourage logo in center\n\nCompany icons to use (from `simple-icons:*` in Iconify):\n- Linear: `simple-icons:linear`\n- Slack: `simple-icons:slack`\n- Calendar: `simple-icons:googlecalendar`\n- Email: `lucide:mail` (no simple-icons equivalent)\n- WhatsApp: `simple-icons:whatsapp`\n- Notion: `simple-icons:notion`\n- Granola: `lucide:wheat` (no simple-icons, use food icon)\n\n```tsx\n// Add Icon import at top\nimport { Icon } from \"./Icon\";\nimport { LogoMark, LogoFull } from \"./Logo\";\n\n// Replace each text-based badge with icon version:\n<g>\n  <rect ... />\n  <foreignObject x=\"35\" y=\"10\" width=\"50\" height=\"20\">\n    <div className=\"w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center\">\n      <Icon icon=\"simple-icons:linear\" size={12} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n    </div>\n  </foreignObject>\n</g>\n\n// Update center Entourage node to use LogoMark:\n<g>\n  <rect x=\"170\" y=\"90\" width=\"60\" height=\"20\" className=\"fill-black dark:fill-white\" />\n  <foreignObject x=\"170\" y=\"90\" width=\"60\" height=\"20\">\n    <div className=\"w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center gap-1\">\n      <LogoMark size={12} className=\"text-white dark:text-black\" />\n      <span className=\"text-[7px] font-semibold text-white dark:text-black\">ENTOURAGE</span>\n    </div>\n  </foreignObject>\n</g>\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] All integration badges show company icons\n- [ ] Center node shows Entourage logo with text\n- [ ] Icons are visible in both light and dark mode\n\n---\n\n## Phase 6: Create BentoFeatures Section\n\n### Overview\nCreate a unified bento grid section combining: Integrations visualization, Data Vault, Never Miss a Task, and Human-in-the-Loop. This replaces separate IntegrationsSection, DataFolderSection, and ValueProps.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create BentoFeatures Component\n**File**: `src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx` (new file)\n**Changes**: Create bento grid layout with 4 feature cards\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { motion, useReducedMotion } from \"framer-motion\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport { Container } from \"./ui/Container\";\nimport { Icon } from \"./Icon\";\nimport { LogoMark } from \"./Logo\";\n\n// Bento grid with 4 cards:\n// - Large card (2x2): Integrations visualization (circuit board mini)\n// - Tall card (1x2): Data Vault (folder animation)\n// - Wide card (2x1): Never Miss a Task\n// - Square card (1x1): Human in the Loop\n\n// Layout on desktop (4 cols):\n// [Integrations 2x2] [DataVault 1x2] [HumanLoop 1x1]\n// [Integrations    ] [DataVault    ] [NeverMiss 2x1]\n\n// Mobile: Stack vertically\n```\n\n#### 2. Create PlusCornerCard Subcomponent\nExtract plus-corner card pattern as reusable component for bento cards.\n\n```tsx\ninterface PlusCornerCardProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  className?: string;\n  dashed?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction PlusCornerCard({ children, className, dashed = true }: PlusCornerCardProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className={cn(\n      \"relative\",\n      dashed ? \"border border-dashed border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\" : \"border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700\",\n      \"bg-white dark:bg-black\",\n      className\n    )}>\n      {/* Plus corners SVGs */}\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Individual Bento Cards\n\n**IntegrationsCard**: Simplified circuit board showing icons flowing to center\n**DataVaultCard**: Folder hover animation (extracted from DataFolderSection)\n**NeverMissCard**: Icon + title + description\n**HumanLoopCard**: Icon + title + description\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] No TypeScript errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Bento grid displays correctly on desktop (4-column layout)\n- [ ] Bento grid stacks properly on mobile\n- [ ] Integrations card shows circuit animation\n- [ ] Data vault folder opens on hover\n- [ ] All cards have plus-corner styling\n\n**Implementation Note**: This is the largest phase. Pause for manual confirmation before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 7: Create FAQ Accordion\n\n### Overview\nCreate a simple FAQ accordion component using shadcn/ui accordion primitive.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Install ShadCN Accordion\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add accordion\n```\n\n#### 2. Create FAQ Component\n**File**: `src/components/FAQ.tsx` (new file)\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { Container } from \"./ui/Container\";\nimport {\n  Accordion,\n  AccordionContent,\n  AccordionItem,\n  AccordionTrigger,\n} from \"@/components/ui/accordion\";\n\nconst faqs = [\n  {\n    question: \"How does Entourage extract tasks from my communications?\",\n    answer: \"Entourage uses AI to analyze your meetings, messages, and emails to identify action items, deadlines, and commitments. It understands context and prioritizes based on your projects.\",\n  },\n  {\n    question: \"Is my data secure?\",\n    answer: \"Yes. Your data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

Update Page Layout\n**File**: `src/app/page.tsx`\n**Changes**: Remove old sections, add new ones in correct order\n\n```tsx\nimport { Header } from \"@/components/Header\";\nimport { Hero } from \"@/components/Hero\";\nimport { TeamCredentialsSection } from \"@/components/TeamCredentialsSection\";\nimport { FlowSection } from \"@/components/FlowSection\";\nimport { BentoFeatures } from \"@/components/BentoFeatures\";\nimport { FAQ } from \"@/components/FAQ\";\nimport { SecondaryCTA } from \"@/components/SecondaryCTA\";\nimport { Footer } from \"@/components/Footer\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Header />\n      <main>\n        <Hero />\n        <TeamCredentialsSection />\n        <FlowSection />\n        <BentoFeatures />\n        <FAQ />\n        <SecondaryCTA />\n      </main>\n      <Footer />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Delete Deprecated Components (optional cleanup)\nCan delete or keep for reference:\n- `src/components/IntegrationsSection.tsx` (replaced by BentoFeatures)\n- `src/components/DataFolderSection.tsx` (merged into BentoFeatures)\n- `src/components/ValueProps.tsx` (merged into BentoFeatures)\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Build passes: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] No unused imports/exports\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Page loads without errors\n- [ ] Section order is: Hero → Credentials → How it works → Features → FAQ → CTA → Footer\n- [ ] Scroll flow feels natural\n- [ ] No duplicate content\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- None required for this visual redesign\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- None required for this visual redesign\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser\n2. Scroll down slowly and verify navbar animation is smooth\n3. Hover over RippleGrid tiles and verify background color changes\n4. Scroll to credentials section and verify readable speed\n5. Verify FlowSection shows SVG logo (not black box)\n6. Verify BentoFeatures grid layout on desktop and mobile\n7. Expand/collapse FAQ items\n8. Test in dark mode\n9. Test on mobile viewport\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- BentoFeatures section may have multiple animations - ensure `useReducedMotion` is respected\n- Circuit board SVG animations should use CSS `offset-path` (already implemented)\n- Folder animation uses inline styles for transforms - acceptable for hover states\n\n## References\n\n- Original handoff: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-12-25_16-30-54_design-system-flowdiagram-improvements.md`\n- Design guide: `entourage_design_guide.md`\n- ShadCN components: `src/components/ui/`\n- Iconify usage: `src/components/Icon.tsx`\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":265,"oldLines":7,"newStart":265,"newLines":7,"lines":[" ### Success Criteria:"," "," #### Automated Verification:","-- [ ] Build passes: `pnpm build`","+- [x] Build passes: `pnpm build`"," "," #### Manual Verification:"," - [ ] All integration badges show company icons"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Either one of those is okay. So just the icon mostly, and then the line starts from there. And then the Entourage logo in the middle should be like the E on top and then the Entourage below. That should be in a more minimal box inside. But I like that it's on a black background, so it differentiates. And then, of course, in the dark mode, it's on a white background.

The icons are now at y=5 to y=29 (24px height from y=5). The lines should start from around y=29 (bottom of icons) and connect properly.\n\nLet me check the current path positions and adjust them. Currently they start at y=30 which should be fine since the icons end at y=29.\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully:\n- Icons top row: y=5, height=24, so they span from y=5 to y=29\n- Lines start at y=30 which is right below the icons - that's good\n- But the lines are positioned at x coordinates: 60, 140, 200, 260, 340\n- My icons are at x coordinates: 48, 128, 188, 248, 328 (with width 24, so centered would be 60, 140, 200, 260, 340)\n\nWait - let me recalculate:\n- Icon at x=48, width=24 → center at x=60 ✓\n- Icon at x=128, width=24 → center at x=140 ✓\n- Icon at x=188, width=24 → center at x=200 ✓\n- Icon at x=248, width=24 → center at x=260 ✓\n- Icon at x=328, width=24 → center at x=340 ✓\n\nGood, the icons are centered on the line positions.\n\nBottom row:\n- Notion at x=128, width=24 → center at x=140, but the path starts at x=140 and the line goes up from y=170\n- Granola at x=248, width=24 → center at x=260, path at x=260\n\nThe bottom icons are at y=171, height=24, so they span from y=171 to y=195. The lines go from y=170 upward.\n\n\nI'll verify the vertical positioning for the bottom row icons. The paths currently terminate at y=170, so I'll adjust the icons to sit just below this point. This means positioning them around y=172 to ensure they're visually aligned with the path endpoints while maintaining a clean layout.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3871,"cache_read_input_tokens":73420,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3871,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWUg6Qdj6ujkDQFf2kPBF","type":"assistant","uuid":"d5483a7a-c441-4646-a233-6792ac3680a6","timestamp":"2025-12-26T04:34:12.521Z"}

Change Google Calendar icon to Google Drive\n2. Add Fireflies AI logo\n\nLet me update the IntegrationsSection. I'll need to:\n1. Change `simple-icons:googlecalendar` to `simple-icons:googledrive`\n2. Add a Fireflies AI icon - let me check if there's a simple-icons for Fireflies. If not, I might need to use a generic icon or find an alternative.\n\nLooking at simple-icons, I don't think there's a Fireflies AI icon. Let me use a microphone or audio icon as a placeholder, or check if there's one available. Actually, I could use `simple-icons:firefly` but that's Adobe Firefly, not Fireflies AI. \n\nLet me use something like `lucide:mic` for Fireflies since it's a meeting transcription tool, or I could look for a better alternative. Actually, Fireflies.ai is a meeting notes/transcription tool, so a microphone icon makes sense.\n\nI need to add this to the existing icons. Currently there are:\n- Top row: Linear, Slack, Calendar (→ Drive), Email, WhatsApp (5 icons)\n- Bottom row: Notion, Granola (2 icons)\n\nI should add Fireflies somewhere. Maybe add it to the bottom row or adjust the layout. Let me add it to the bottom row for now, which would make it 3 icons on the bottom.\n\nBut wait, looking at the circuit paths, there are only paths defined for 5 top icons and 2 bottom icons. If I add another icon, I'd need to add a path for it too. Let me keep it simple and maybe replace one of the existing icons or adjust positions.\n\nActually, looking at the current layout:\n- Top row has 5 icons at x positions centered at: 60, 140, 200, 260, 340\n- Bottom row has 2 icons centered at: 140, 260\n\n\nI'll strategically place the Fireflies icon at x=200, creating a new circuit path to integrate it seamlessly into the bottom row's layout.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":26,"cache_read_input_tokens":78873,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":26,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWUgQuLPLUqb8frLwfe5b","type":"assistant","uuid":"7a75347a-3d6a-4927-8622-20b1bb650cb8","timestamp":"2025-12-26T04:38:28.350Z"}

Replace the single Email icon with two icons: Gmail and Outlook\n2. Add O365 (Office 365/Microsoft 365) icon\n\nSo I need to add 2 more icons to the top row. Currently we have 5 icons in the top row:\n- Linear\n- Slack\n- Google Drive\n- Email (to be replaced with Gmail + Outlook)\n- WhatsApp\n\nAfter the change, we'll have 6 icons:\n- Linear\n- Slack\n- Google Drive\n- Gmail\n- Outlook\n- WhatsApp\n\nPlus O365 somewhere - maybe in the bottom row or top row.\n\nLet me think about the layout. The current SVG viewBox is 400x200. The top row icons are at x positions centered at: 60, 140, 200, 260, 340.\n\nIf I add more icons, I'll need to redistribute them. Let me recalculate for 7 icons in the top row (Linear, Slack, Google Drive, Gmail, Outlook, O365, WhatsApp):\n\nActually, looking at this again, maybe I should put O365 in the bottom row with Notion, Fireflies, and Granola. That would make:\n- Top row: Linear, Slack, Google Drive, Gmail, Outlook, WhatsApp (6 icons)\n- Bottom row: Notion, Fireflies, Granola, O365 (4 icons)\n\nLet me recalculate positions for 6 icons in the top row. The viewBox is 400 wide, so I could space them evenly:\n- Start at x=40, end at x=360, that's 320px of space for 6 icons\n- Spacing: 320 / 5 = 64px between centers\n- Centers at: 40, 104, 168, 232, 296, 360\n\nActually, let me keep it simpler and just adjust the existing positions slightly. Currently:\n\n\n- 60, 140, 200, 260, 340 (5 icons, spread over 280px from 60 to 340)\n\nI'll modify the x-coordinates to accommodate 6 icons while maintaining a similar spread. I'll use a slightly compressed range to keep the icons proportional. The new positions will be more evenly distributed across the 400px width, ensuring each icon has enough space without overcrowding the design.\n\nFor the bottom row, I'll strategically place the 4 icons to balance the layout, potentially using similar spacing principles as the top row. The goal is to create a visually harmonious arrangement that feels intentional and clean.\n\nI'm focusing on simplifying the circuit paths by making minimal adjustments. Replacing Email with Gmail and adding Outlook requires careful positioning to maintain the overall design's integrity. The key is subtle repositioning that doesn't disrupt the existing visual rhythm.\n\nMy current approach involves incrementally adjusting icon placements, ensuring each move serves the overall composition's clarity and aesthetic balance.\n\nThe top row now spans from 45 to 345, with consistent 60px spacing between icons. This creates a systematic grid that accommodates the new Gmail and Outlook additions while preserving the original layout's proportions.\n\nThe bottom row follows a similar strategy, positioning Notion, Fireflies, Granola, and O365 with precise 60px intervals. By maintaining these consistent spacing rules, I can integrate new elements without extensive redesign.\n\nThe next steps involve updating specific technical elements like foreignObject positions, circuit paths, masks, and CSS animations to reflect these nuanced icon placements.\n\nI'll strategically insert Outlook between the existing Email and WhatsApp positions, minimizing path modifications. The current Email trajectory from x=260 downward provides a natural insertion point for this adjustment.\n\nThe revised layout now features six icons on the top row and four on the bottom, with carefully calculated x-coordinate centers ensuring visual balance and systematic progression.\n\nTop row coordinates will shift to accommodate the new configuration: Linear at 50, Slack at 102, Drive at 154, Gmail at 206, Outlook at 258, and WhatsApp at 310. These precise placements maintain a consistent spacing interval.\n\nPath coordinates will require corresponding updates to match the new icon positions, ensuring smooth connectivity across the interface. The goal is minimal disruption while integrating the new elements seamlessly.\n\nI'm gravitating toward a pragmatic solution that preserves most existing positions while strategically introducing

Current bottom row x positions: 140, 200, 260 (3 icons).\n\nFor 5 icons, I'll use: 80, 140, 200, 260, 320And I'll need to add 2 new paths and masks for Outlook (at x=80) and O365 (at x=320).","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":205,"cache_read_input_tokens":96507,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":205,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWUhwqTD4ByR6j8cGNaEX","type":"assistant","uuid":"6ce88459-e716-4619-82c1-ed6eaf17ccfd","timestamp":"2025-12-26T04:58:21.421Z"}

The plus signs should be:\n- 20px x 20px (w-5 h-5)\n- Positioned at -10px offset from corners (half of 20px, equivalent to -2.5 in the w-5 context)\n\nLooking at the FlowSection:- The plus SVG is 20px (w-5)\n- Positioned at -10px (-2.5 * 4 = -10px or -2.5 in the rem context, but w-5 = 1.25rem = 20px, so -2.5 = -0.625rem = -10px)\n\nFor the IntegrationsSection SVG, the rectangle is at:\n- x=168, y=78, width=64, height=44- Corners: (168, 78), (232, 78), (168, 122), (232, 122)\n\nTo match the FlowSection style with a 5x5 plus sign (in the SVG coordinate system, not pixels), centered at -2.5 offset from corners:\n- Top-left: center at (168-2.5, 78-2.5) = (165.5, 75.5)\n- Top-right: center at (232+2.5, 78-2.5) = (234.5, 75.5)\n- Bottom-left: center at (168-2.5, 122+2.5) = (165.5, 124.5)\n\n\n- Bottom-right: center at (232+2.5, 122+2.5) = (234.5, 124.5)\n\nI'll construct the SVG path for the plus sign, creating vertical and horizontal lines within the 5x5 grid. The coordinates will define precise positioning for each plus sign at the rectangle's corners, ensuring consistent styling across the design.\n\nThe CSS positioning with `-top-2.5 -left-2.5` reveals the plus sign's true center relative to the container, suggesting a precise alignment strategy that centers the 20px SVG element precisely.\n\nTailwind's default configuration translates these negative offsets, placing the SVG's center exactly at the container's corner. This means the plus sign centers can be strategically positioned at specific rectangle coordinates: top-left at (168, 78), top-right at (232, 78), bottom-left at (168, 122), and bottom-right at (232, 122).\n\nI'll create precise SVG path commands for a 5px plus sign, adjusting vertical and horizontal lines to center each sign at the designated coordinates. The resulting paths will offset the vertical and horizontal lines by 2.5px to create symmetrical plus signs.\n\nThe calculated paths match the exact coordinates, ensuring each plus sign is perfectly centered at the intended corner points. However, the visual representation suggests a potential discrepancy that requires further investigation.\n\nI'll verify the rectangle's dimensions and confirm the exact positioning, potentially increasing the plus sign size to 8px for better visual alignment with the FlowSection design.\n\nExamining the path commands for the top-left corner at (168, 78), I'll create precise SVG line segments. The vertical line centers at x=168, spanning from y=75.5 to y=80.5, while the horizontal line centers at y=78, extending from x=165.5 to x=170.5.\n\nThe key insight emerges: the plus signs exist at

The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. **Initial Context (from summary)**: The user was working on a landing page redesign for \"Entourage\" - an AI-powered task management app. Phases 1-4 were complete, and the user was continuing with Phase 5 (adding company icons to IntegrationsSection).\n\n2. **Phase 5 Implementation**: I was asked to implement Phase 5 - replacing text labels with Iconify company icons in IntegrationsSection. I:\n   - Added imports for Icon and LogoMark\n   - Replaced text labels with foreignObject + Icon components for: Linear, Slack, Google Calendar, Email, WhatsApp, Notion, Granola\n   - Updated center Entourage node with LogoMark\n\n3. **User Feedback on Integration Icons**: User wanted:\n   - Remove boxes from integration icons (just show icons with lines)\n   - Entourage center: E on top, text below\n   - Keep black/white background differentiation\n\n4. **Icon Changes**:\n   - Changed Google Calendar to Google Drive\n   - Added Fireflies AI icon\n   - Renamed icon files (Fireflies.ai_idjU1WbcfM_0.svg → fireflies.svg, granola-icon.svg → granola.svg)\n\n5. **Email Split**: User wanted Email split into Gmail and Outlook, plus add O365\n\n6. **Layout Simplification**: User said both rows should have 5 icons (matching top row layout). I reduced bottom row to 5 icons.\n\n7. **Entourage Centerpiece Updates**:\n   - Changed from black box to white background with dotted border\n   - Added plus corner marks\n   - User said plus signs were too big and dashed line should be dotted\n\n8. **Added ChatGPT**: Added OpenAI icon to integrations\n\n9. **Granola SVG**: Modified viewBox to remove whitespace (from \"0 0 1024 1024\" to \"220 175 570 680\")\n\n10. **Gmail Icon**: Changed from simple-icons:gmail to mdi:gmail\n\n11. **Plus Signs Fix**: User said plus signs on Entourage center weren't properly placed. I updated coordinates.\n\n12. **Final User Request**: User showed HTML from FlowSection's main processing box and asked me to check if it's actually used, and if not, delete it.\n\nKey files:\n- IntegrationsSection.tsx - Main file being modified\n- globals.css - Circuit signal animations\n- public/icons/granola.svg - Modified viewBox\n- public/icons/fireflies.svg - Renamed\n- FlowSection.tsx - User asked to verify if used\n- page.tsx - To check if FlowSection is used\n\nCurrent state: FlowSection IS being used in page.tsx (line 19). The user asked me to verify if it's used and delete it if not. Since it IS used, I should report this to the user.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Continue implementing landing page redesign starting from Phase 5\n   - Replace text labels with company icons in IntegrationsSection\n   - Redesign Entourage centerpiece with white background, dotted border, and plus corners\n   - Add integrations: Google Drive (replacing Calendar), Fireflies AI, ChatGPT, Gmail, Outlook\n   - Simplify layout to 5 icons top row, 5 icons bottom row (matching positions)\n   - Fix plus sign positioning on Entourage centerpiece\n   - Verify if FlowSection's processing box is actually used in the page\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Iconify icons (simple-icons:*, mdi:*, lucide:*)\n   - SVG foreignObject for embedding HTML/React inside SVG\n   - SVG circuit paths with animated signals using CSS offset-path\n   - Plus corner pattern (matching FlowSection/Hero style)\n   - SVG viewBox cropping for removing whitespace\n   - CSS filters for grayscale icons (grayscale(100%) brightness(0.6))\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`src/components/IntegrationsSection.tsx`** - Main integration visualization\n     - Top row icons at x positions: 60, 140, 200, 260, 340 (Linear, Slack, Drive, Gmail, WhatsApp)\n     - Bottom row icons at same x positions: 60, 140, 200, 260, 340 (Outlook, Notion, ChatGPT, Fireflies, Granola)\n     - Entourage centerpiece with dotted border and plus corners:\n     ```tsx\n     {/* Center Entourage node - white bg with dotted border and plus corners */}\n     <g>\n       {/* Dotted border */}\n       <rect\n         x=\"168\"\n         y=\"78\"\n         width=\"64\"\n         height=\"44\"\n         className=\"fill-white dark:fill-black stroke-zinc-300 dark:stroke-zinc-700\"\n         strokeWidth=\"1\"\n         strokeDasharray=\"2 2\"\n         shapeRendering=\"crispEdges\"\n       />\n       {/* Plus corners - matching FlowSection style (10px size, centered on corners) */}\n       <g className=\"stroke-zinc-400 dark:stroke-zinc-600\" strokeWidth=\"1\" fill=\"none\">\n         {/* Top-left plus at (168, 78) */}\n         <path d=\"M 168 73 v 10 M 163 78 h 10\" />\n         {/* Top-right plus at (232, 78) */}\n         <path d=\"M 232 73 v 10 M 227 78 h 10\" />\n         {/* Bottom-left plus at (168, 122) */}\n         <path d=\"M 168 117 v 10 M 163 122 h 10\" />\n         {/* Bottom-right plus at (232, 122) */}\n         <path d=\"M 232 117 v 10 M 227 122 h 10\" />\n       </g>\n       {/* Content */}\n       <foreignObject x=\"168\" y=\"78\" width=\"64\" height=\"44\">\n         <div className=\"w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center\">\n           <LogoMark size={22} className=\"text-black dark:text-white\" />\n           <span className=\"text-[6px] font-semibold text-black dark:text-white font-mono tracking-wider mt-0.5\">\n             ENTOURAGE\n           </span>\n         </div>\n       </foreignObject>\n     </g>\n     ```\n     - Custom SVG icons with grayscale filter:\n     ```tsx\n     {/* Fireflies AI */}\n     <foreignObject x=\"248\" y=\"171\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\">\n       <div className=\"w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center\">\n         <img\n           src=\"/icons/fireflies.svg\"\n           alt=\"Fireflies\"\n           className=\"w-[18px] h-[18px]\"\n           style={{ filter: 'grayscale(100%) brightness(0.6)', opacity: 0.7 }}\n         />\n       </div>\n     </foreignObject>\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/app/globals.css`** - Circuit signal animations (10 signals for 5 top + 5 bottom icons)\n     ```css\n     .circuit-signal-6 {\n       offset-path: path(\"M 60 170 v -35 q 0 -5 5 -5 h 115 q 5 0 5 -5 v -25\");\n       animation-delay: 2.5s;\n       animation-duration: 4s;\n     }\n     /* ... signals 7-10 for bottom row */\n     ```\n\n   - **`public/icons/granola.svg`** - Cropped viewBox to remove whitespace\n     ```svg\n     <svg width=\"570\" height=\"680\" viewBox=\"220 175 570 680\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/components/FlowSection.tsx`** - Contains plus corner pattern reference and processing box (IS being used)\n   \n   - **`src/app/page.tsx`** - Confirms FlowSection IS being used on line 19\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Plus signs too big**: User said Entourage centerpiece plus signs were too large. Fixed by matching FlowSection style.\n   - **Plus signs not positioned correctly**: User said they weren't at corners. Fixed by calculating exact corner coordinates (168,78), (232,78), (168,122), (232,122) and centering 10px plus signs on them.\n   - **Dashed vs dotted border**: User wanted dotted line. Changed strokeDasharray from \"4 2\" to \"2 2\".\n   - **Granola icon too small with whitespace**: Modified SVG viewBox from \"0 0 1024 1024\" to \"220 175 570 680\".\n   - **Custom SVG icons showing in color**: Added inline style filter: `grayscale(100%) brightness(0.6)` with opacity: 0.7.\n   - **Gmail icon looked bad**: Changed from `simple-icons:gmail` to `mdi:gmail`.\n   - **Layout mismatch**: User said both rows should have 5 icons. Simplified bottom row to match top row positions.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Successfully simplified IntegrationsSection to symmetric 5x5 layout\n   - Fixed Entourage centerpiece styling with dotted border and properly positioned plus corners\n   - Applied grayscale filter to custom SVG icons (Fireflies, Granola)\n   - Cropped Granola SVG to remove excessive whitespace\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"Just remove the boxes from around them, or make them like just the dashed, minimal dashed lines with pluses in the corners around...\"\n   - \"Change the Google Calendar logo to be just Google Drive. And Add Fireflies AI logo there.\"\n   - \"Rename the granola icon to just be granola.\"\n   - \"Expand the email icon, make that into two, so you would have Gmail icon and also Outlook icon and also add o365 there\"\n   - \"Make the SVGs to be gray like the other icons. Also, the granola icon is just too small.\"\n   - \"And I think you could do a better job with the entourage in the middle... just have dashed borders with the plus icon and the marks on the corners.\"\n   - \"And we need to add one more integration. Let's add ChatGPT. Also The + signs on the entourage are just too big, make them smaller... Also, the dashed line is just, or you should make it a dotted line.\"\n   - \"You should just copy how the layout works on the top part. As both of them have 5 inputs.\"\n   - \"Modify the granular SVG to have less white space around it.\"\n   - \"Modify the change to use a different Gmail icon. I just think that it doesn't look good now.\"\n   - \"The entourage middle piece corner + signs are not properly in place.\"\n   - \"From the Flowcharts entourage section, and how those borders are made.\"\n   - User showed FlowSection HTML and asked: \"I want you to check if that acts actually true and if that's actually used. If it's not, I want you to delete that.\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Report to user that FlowSection IS being used (imported and rendered in page.tsx)\n   - Continue with remaining phases (Phase 6: BentoFeatures, Phase 7: FAQ, Phase 8: Section reorder) when user is ready\n\n8. Current Work:\n   User showed the FlowSection's main processing box HTML and asked me to verify if it's actually being used. I checked:\n   - `src/components/FlowSection.tsx` - Contains the processing box with pulse rings, center logo, and Extract/Organize badges\n   - `src/app/page.tsx` - Shows `<FlowSection />` IS being used on line 19\n   \n   The FlowSection component IS actively being used in the page.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Report to the user that FlowSection IS being used in page.tsx (line 19: `<FlowSection />`), so it should NOT be deleted. The processing box with pulse rings, Entourage logo, and Extract/Organize badges is part of the live page.\n\n   User's exact request: \"I want you to check if that acts actually true and if that's actually used. If it's not, I want you to delete that.\"\n   \n   Finding: It IS used, so I should inform the user rather than delete it..\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."},"isVisibleInTranscriptOnly":true,"isCompactSummary":true,"uuid":"b183e988-5385-49c9-841f-a7ad1cc77742","timestamp":"2025-12-26T05:12:58.319Z"}
