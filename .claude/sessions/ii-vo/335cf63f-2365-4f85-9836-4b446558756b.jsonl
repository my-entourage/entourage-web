Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n\n2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n\n   **For codebase research:**\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)\n   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to find examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.\n\n   **For thoughts directory:**\n   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic\n   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)\n\n   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n\n   **For Linear tickets (if relevant):**\n   - Use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details of a specific ticket\n   - Use the **linear-searcher** agent to find related tickets or historical context\n\n   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings to document how they work\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n   - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving\n\n4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/allison/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n\n5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**\n   - Run the `hack/spec_metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata\n   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n     - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n       - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n       - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic\n     - Examples:\n       - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n       - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`\n\n6. **Generate research document:**\n   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4\n   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n     ```markdown\n     ---\n     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]\n     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     git_commit: [Current commit hash]\n     branch: [Current branch name]\n     repository: [Repository name]\n     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n     status: complete\n     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]\n     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]\n     ---\n\n     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]\n     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]\n     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]\n     **Repository**: [Repository name]\n\n     ## Research Question\n     [Original user query]\n\n     ## Summary\n     [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]\n\n     ## Detailed Findings\n\n     ### [Component/Area 1]\n     - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))\n     - How it connects to other components\n     - Current implementation details (without evaluation)\n\n     ### [Component/Area 2]\n     ...\n\n     ## Code References\n     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there\n     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block\n\n     ## Architecture Documentation\n     [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]\n\n     ## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n     [Relevant insights from thoughts/ directory with references]\n     - `thoughts/shared/something.md` - Historical decision about X\n     - `thoughts/local/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y\n     Note: Paths exclude \"searchable/\" even if found there\n\n     ## Related Research\n     [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]\n\n     ## Open Questions\n     [Any areas that need further investigation]\n     ```\n\n7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**\n   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`\n   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:\n     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`\n     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`\n   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document\n\n8. **Sync and present findings:**\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the thoughts directory\n   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user\n   - Include key file references for easy navigation\n   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification\n\n9. **Handle follow-up questions:**\n   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document\n   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update\n   - Add `last_updated_note: \"Added follow-up research for [brief description]\"` to frontmatter\n   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`\n   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation\n   - Continue updating the document and syncing\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage\n- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents\n- The thoughts/ directory provides historical context to supplement live findings\n- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference\n- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context\n- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations\n- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact\n- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)\n- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references\n- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading\n- Have sub-agents document examples and usage patterns as they exist\n- Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory\n- **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators\n- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE\n- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase\n- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks\n- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly\n  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)\n  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)\n  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)\n  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values\n- **Path handling**: The thoughts/searchable/ directory contains hard links for searching\n  - Always document paths by removing ONLY \"searchable/\" - preserve all other subdirectories\n  - Examples of correct transformations:\n    - `thoughts/searchable/allison/old_stuff/notes.md` → `thoughts/allison/old_stuff/notes.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/shared/prs/123.md` → `thoughts/shared/prs/123.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/global/shared/templates.md` → `thoughts/global/shared/templates.md`\n  - NEVER change allison/ to shared/ or vice versa - preserve the exact directory structure\n  - This ensures paths are correct for editing and navigation\n- **Frontmatter consistency**:\n  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents\n  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents\n  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research\n  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)\n  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"30ca260b-21f9-40c0-b0db-54d88db1a33c","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:47:07.259Z"}

Let me analyze what's happening here:\n\n1. **sw.js errors** - These are coming from a service worker (`sw.js`). The errors mention:\n   - `jamToggleDumpStore` - This looks like it's from a browser extension (likely \"Jam\" - a bug reporting tool)\n   - `mobx-state-tree` errors - These are also from the service worker, talking about detached state tree nodes\n\n2. **HMR connected** - This is just Next.js Hot Module Replacement connecting, which is normal\n\n3. **Image warnings** - These are from Next.js/React about images that have width OR height set but not both, suggesting adding `width: \"auto\"` or `height: \"auto\"` to maintain aspect ratio. The affected images are:\n   - `/logos/deepmind.svg`\n   - `/logos/mckinsey.svg`\n   - `/logos/bain.svg`\n   - `/logos/google.svg`\n   - `/logos/aalto.png`\n   - `/logos/harvard.svg`\n\nThe key thing to note here:\n- The `sw.js` and `mobx-state-tree` errors are **NOT from the Entourage codebase** - they're from a browser extension (likely Jam or similar).

Looking at the code:\n\n```tsx\n<Image\n  src={cred.logo}\n  alt={cred.name}\n  width={120}\n  height={32}\n  className={cn(\n    \"h-6 md:h-8 w-auto object-contain\",\n    cred.logoDark ? \"dark:hidden\" : \"\",\n    cred.className\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\nThe issue is:\n1. Next.js `Image` component is given `width={120}` and `height={32}` as props\n2. CSS is then applied with `h-6 md:h-8 w-auto` which overrides the height but uses `w-auto` for width\n\nThe warning from Next.js is essentially saying: \"You set width={120} and height={32} in the component props, but then CSS is modifying just one dimension (height via h-6/h-8). To maintain aspect ratio, you should also set width: auto in CSS.\"\n\nThe current code already has `w-auto` in the className, but the warning persists because Next.js Image component handles dimensions specially.\n\nThe fix options are:\n\n1. **Add explicit `style` prop**: Add `style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }}` to the Image component, then let CSS classes take over sizing\n2. **Use fill prop with container sizing**: Use `fill` prop with a sized container\n3. **Remove CSS height override**: Keep Next.js dimensions and don't override with CSS (but this loses responsive sizing)\n\nThe cleanest solution is option 1: add `style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }}` which tells Next.js to not enforce the width/height props as inline styles, allowing CSS to control sizing while still providing aspect ratio hints for layout.\n\nActually, looking at the Next.js docs, when you set `width` and `height` props, they are used for layout calculation AND are applied as inline styles. \n\nI see the potential dimension distortion when CSS manipulates image sizing. Next.js wants to ensure proportional scaling, so adding an inline style with `height: 'auto'` allows responsive CSS sizing while maintaining the original aspect ratio. This approach prevents unintended stretching or squashing of the image when responsive breakpoints change the height.\n\nThe inline style override ensures CSS can dynamically control both width and height dimensions without being constrained by Next.js's default inline sizing. By explicitly setting both dimensions to 'auto', we give CSS full control over the image's responsive behavior.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2232,"cache_read_input_tokens":29932,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2232,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWVQcAWQ579rA7RwQpa8U","type":"assistant","uuid":"c6a1a0db-f4f2-49ac-b9f7-559426c62167","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:51:49.446Z"}

This is causing the logos to be too large because it overrides the CSS height classes.\n\nThe issue is that there's some automated process (likely Prettier or a save hook) that keeps adding this style prop back. We need to find a different solution that works WITH the style prop, not against it.\n\nSince the style prop with `width: 'auto', height: 'auto'` is being enforced, we need to control sizing differently. Options:\n\n1. Use explicit pixel values in the style prop instead of auto\n2. Use `!important` in CSS (hacky)\n3. Use native `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image>`\n4. Set max-height in the style prop\n\nLet me try setting explicit height in the style prop since that's what's being enforced:\n\n```tsx\nstyle={{ width: 'auto', height: '24px' }}  // h-6 = 1.5rem = 24px\n```\n\nOr use CSS custom properties... Actually, the cleanest solution might be to just use native `<img>` tags since we're fighting Next.js Image's behavior.\n\nLet me switch to native `<img>` - it will give full CSS control and eliminate the warnings. The tradeoff is we lose lazy loading, but for small logos in view immediately, that's fine.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":51386,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":51386,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWVV8ysWhV2iDT6akVzwe","type":"assistant","uuid":"d41986d5-dd1f-4ddc-99ed-8c3c9fcbe785","timestamp":"2025-12-26T14:51:04.725Z"}
