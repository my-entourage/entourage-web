Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n\n2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n\n   **For codebase research:**\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)\n   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to find examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.\n\n   **For thoughts directory:**\n   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic\n   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)\n\n   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n\n   **For Linear tickets (if relevant):**\n   - Use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details of a specific ticket\n   - Use the **linear-searcher** agent to find related tickets or historical context\n\n   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings to document how they work\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n   - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving\n\n4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/allison/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n\n5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**\n   - Run the `hack/spec_metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata\n   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n     - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n       - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n       - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic\n     - Examples:\n       - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n       - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`\n\n6. **Generate research document:**\n   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4\n   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n     ```markdown\n     ---\n     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]\n     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     git_commit: [Current commit hash]\n     branch: [Current branch name]\n     repository: [Repository name]\n     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n     status: complete\n     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]\n     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]\n     ---\n\n     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]\n     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]\n     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]\n     **Repository**: [Repository name]\n\n     ## Research Question\n     [Original user query]\n\n     ## Summary\n     [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]\n\n     ## Detailed Findings\n\n     ### [Component/Area 1]\n     - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))\n     - How it connects to other components\n     - Current implementation details (without evaluation)\n\n     ### [Component/Area 2]\n     ...\n\n     ## Code References\n     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there\n     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block\n\n     ## Architecture Documentation\n     [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]\n\n     ## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n     [Relevant insights from thoughts/ directory with references]\n     - `thoughts/shared/something.md` - Historical decision about X\n     - `thoughts/local/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y\n     Note: Paths exclude \"searchable/\" even if found there\n\n     ## Related Research\n     [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]\n\n     ## Open Questions\n     [Any areas that need further investigation]\n     ```\n\n7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**\n   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`\n   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:\n     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`\n     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`\n   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document\n\n8. **Sync and present findings:**\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the thoughts directory\n   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user\n   - Include key file references for easy navigation\n   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification\n\n9. **Handle follow-up questions:**\n   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document\n   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update\n   - Add `last_updated_note: \"Added follow-up research for [brief description]\"` to frontmatter\n   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`\n   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation\n   - Continue updating the document and syncing\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage\n- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents\n- The thoughts/ directory provides historical context to supplement live findings\n- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference\n- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context\n- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations\n- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact\n- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)\n- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references\n- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading\n- Have sub-agents document examples and usage patterns as they exist\n- Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory\n- **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators\n- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE\n- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase\n- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks\n- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly\n  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)\n  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)\n  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)\n  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values\n- **Path handling**: The thoughts/searchable/ directory contains hard links for searching\n  - Always document paths by removing ONLY \"searchable/\" - preserve all other subdirectories\n  - Examples of correct transformations:\n    - `thoughts/searchable/allison/old_stuff/notes.md` → `thoughts/allison/old_stuff/notes.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/shared/prs/123.md` → `thoughts/shared/prs/123.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/global/shared/templates.md` → `thoughts/global/shared/templates.md`\n  - NEVER change allison/ to shared/ or vice versa - preserve the exact directory structure\n  - This ensures paths are correct for editing and navigation\n- **Frontmatter consistency**:\n  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents\n  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents\n  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research\n  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)\n  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"78603009-0a1c-41f3-8c54-f89cb1230776","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:04:01.820Z"}

I now have a comprehensive understanding of the landing page implementation. Let me create a summary document of my findings.\n\n## Landing Page Implementation Analysis\n\nI've completed a thorough exploration of the landing page implementation. Here's what I found:\n\n### 1. Main Page Structure\n**File**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/page.tsx`\n\nThe landing page is composed of a clean, modular section-based architecture:\n\n```\nHome\n├── Header\n├── main\n│   ├── Hero\n│   ├── TeamCredentialsSection\n│   ├── FlowSection\n│   ├── BentoFeatures\n│   ├── SecondaryCTA\n│   └── FAQ\n└── Footer\n```\n\n### 2. Core Section Components\n\n| Component | File Path | Purpose |\n|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| **Header** | `src/components/Header.tsx` | Sticky navigation with Framer Motion scroll detection, logo toggle, theme switcher, login button |\n| **Hero** | `src/components/Hero.tsx` | Main headline with staggered fade-up animations, dashed border with plus corners, CTA button |\n| **TeamCredentialsSection** | `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx` | Logo carousel with infinite slider, dark mode logo variants, hover effects |\n| **FlowSection** | `src/components/FlowSection.tsx` | AI processing diagram with input badges, animated pulse rings, floating badges, output display |\n| **BentoFeatures** | `src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx` | 4-column grid with 2 custom bento cards and 2 simple feature cards |\n| **SecondaryCTA** | `src/components/SecondaryCTA.tsx` | Scroll-triggered animation with viewport detection, waitlist messaging |\n| **FAQ** | `src/components/FAQ.tsx` | ShadCN accordion component with styled borders and spacing |\n| **Footer** | `src/components/Footer.tsx` | Copyright, social links (X/GitHub), minimal styling |\n\n### 3. Specialized Bento Grid Cards\n\n**IntegrationsCard** (`src/components/bento/IntegrationsCard.tsx`):\n- SVG circuit board diagram with 10 integration icons\n- Animated circuit paths with stroke-dasharray animation\n- Green radial gradient signal lights following circuit paths\n- Center Entourage node with plus corners\n\n**DataVaultCard** (`src/components/bento/DataVaultCard.tsx`):\n- 3D folder visualization with hover-triggered animations\n- Perspective transforms (rotateX) on front/back panels\n- Animated data cards (Meeting Notes, Slack Threads, Email Chains) that fan out on hover\n- Security icon always visible in 3D space\n- Smooth cubic-bezier transitions (500-600ms)\n\n### 4. UI Component Primitives\n\n| Component | File Path | Details |\n|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| **Container** | `src/components/ui/Container.tsx` | Responsive wrapper: `max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 md:px-12` |\n| **Button** | `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` | 4 variants (primary, solid, secondary, ghost) × 2 sizes (default, lg), no border-radius |\n| **PlusCornerCard** | `src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx` | Reusable card with 4 plus-sign corners, dashed/solid border toggle |\n| **InfiniteSlider** | `src/components/ui/InfiniteSlider.tsx` | Custom infinite scroll component with gap and speed props |\n| **Accordion** | `src/components/ui/accordion.tsx` | ShadCN wrapper component for FAQ |\n\n### 5. Supporting Components\n\n**Icon** (`src/components/Icon.tsx`):\n- Wrapper around `@iconify-icon/react`\n- Configurable size prop\n- Used throughout for icons (lucide, simple-icons, mdi)\n\n**Logo** (`src/components/Logo.tsx`):\n- **LogoMark**: E-block mark (40% spine, 27% bar height, 10% gaps)\n- **LogoFull**: Mark + wordmark with optional text toggle\n\n**ThemeToggle** (`src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`): Light/dark mode switcher\n\n### 6. Design System Implementation Patterns\n\n**Container Layout**:\n```tsx\n<Container>\n  <div className=\"max-w-3xl mx-auto px-6 md:px-12\">\n    {/* Content */}\n  </div>\n</Container>\n```\n\n**Plus Corners Pattern** (used everywhere):\n- 4 SVG plus signs positioned absolutely at corners\n- Classes: `absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600`\n- Consistent across sections for brand identity\n\n**Dark Mode Pattern**:\n- All color classes paired: `text-black dark:text-white`\n- All borders: `border-black dark:border-white` OR `border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700`\n- CSS variables in globals.css with `.dark` class selector\n\n**Section Spacing**:\n- Container padding: `py-16 md:py-24` (standard)\n- Hero/SecondaryCTA: `py-20 md:py-28` (larger breathing room)\n\n**Border Style**:\n- Solid borders: `border border-black dark:border-white`\n- Dashed borders: `border border-dashed border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800`\n- Muted borders: `border border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700`\n\n### 7. Animation Patterns\n\n**Framer Motion Usage**:\n- **Header**: `useMotionValueEvent` + `useScroll()` for scroll detection, scale animation\n- **Hero**: Staggered `fadeUp` animations with `prefersReducedMotion` check\n- **SecondaryCTA**: `whileInView` viewport animations with `once: true`\n- **DataVaultCard**: CSS transforms with cubic-bezier easing (no Framer)\n\n**CSS Animations** (globals.css):\n- Circuit signal animations along SVG paths using `offset-path`\n- Infinite scroll animations with keyframes\n- Pulse animations for FlowSection rings\n- All with staggered delays for sequential effect\n\n### 8. Styling Architecture\n\n**globals.css** includes:\n- Tailwind v4 imports with custom variants\n- OKLCH color variables for light/dark modes\n- Font definitions (`--font-switzer`, `--font-geist-mono`)\n- Named animation keyframes\n- Base layer fixes\n\n**tailwind.config**:\n- Not shown, but configured with Tailwind v4\n- Supports custom brand colors and animations\n\n**cn() utility** (`src/lib/utils.ts`):\n- Extended tailwind-merge for semantic colors\n- Supports brand color groups like `bg-background`, `text-foreground`\n\n### 9. Composition Architecture\n\n**Top-level file reuse**:\n- `Container` component wraps all major sections\n- `PlusCornerCard` reused for Bento cards + Hero content\n- `Icon` component used consistently across all sections\n- Button component with variant/size props\n\n**Props pattern**:\n- Most sections accept optional `className` prop for customization\n- No internal prop drilling; components are self-contained\n- TypeScript interfaces for component contracts\n\n**Client vs Server**:\n- Most components are `\"use client\"` (interactive animations)\n- Layout and Footer are server components (static)\n- No dynamic data fetching on landing page\n\n### Key Design System Adherence\n\n1. **No border-radius**: All components use `rounded-none` (sharp corners)\n2. **Plus corners trademark**: Used in Hero, FlowSection, BentoFeatures, and custom cards\n3. **Color palette**: Black/white primary, zinc grays for muted elements, emerald for accents (green in circuit signals)\n4. **Typography**: Switzer for body, Geist Mono for labels/accents\n5. **Spacing**: Consistent 16/24px section padding with responsive adjustments\n6. **Dark mode**: Systematic pairing of light/dark variants throughout\n7. **Animations**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`, fast UI animations (100-150ms), slower ambient (2-4s)\n\nThis implementation is highly modular, visually cohesive, and fully compliant with the design system guidelines documented in `docs/design-system.md`."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: acf03d0 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"uuid":"d89ba407-51d0-4142-9282-5dcd1310e6ec","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:05:45.954Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the landing page implementation in this codebase.

Now I have a complete picture. Let me create a comprehensive analysis document.\n\n---\n\n## Analysis: UI Components in src/components/ui/\n\n### Overview\n\nThe project contains a hybrid UI component architecture combining custom-built brand components with a single ShadCN component. Five components exist in `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/`: three custom brand components (`Button.tsx`, `PlusCornerCard.tsx`, `Container.tsx`), one animation utility (`InfiniteSlider.tsx`), and one ShadCN-installed component (`accordion.tsx`). No wrapper pattern is implemented—the ShadCN accordion is customized directly in consuming components rather than through a branded wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### UI Components Inventory\n\n#### 1. Button Component (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/Button.tsx`)\n\n**Type**: Custom brand component\n\n**Implementation Pattern**:\n- Lines 3-7: TypeScript interface extending `ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>`\n- Lines 5-6: Supports 4 variants (`primary`, `solid`, `secondary`, `ghost`) and 2 sizes (`default`, `lg`)\n- Lines 16-17: Base styles include focus ring, transitions, cursor pointer\n- Lines 19-28: Variant styles object with hardcoded dark mode classes\n- Lines 30-33: Size styles object defining height and padding\n- Line 37: Manual string concatenation for className composition (not using `cn()`)\n\n**Variant Specifications**:\n| Variant | Background | Text | Border | Border Radius |\n|---------|-----------|------|--------|---------------|\n| `primary` | `bg-background` | `text-black dark:text-white` | `border-black dark:border-white` | `rounded-none` |\n| `solid` | `bg-black dark:bg-white` | `text-white dark:text-black` | `border-black dark:border-white` | `rounded-none` |\n| `secondary` | `bg-transparent` | `text-black dark:text-white` | `border-black dark:border-white` | `rounded-none` |\n| `ghost` | `bg-transparent` | `text-black dark:text-white` | `border-transparent hover:border-zinc-200/700` | `rounded-none` |\n\n**Usage Across Landing Page**:\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/Hero.tsx:78` - `variant=\"solid\" size=\"lg\"` for \"Join the Waitlist\" CTA\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/Header.tsx:53` - `variant=\"secondary\" size=\"default\"` for \"Login\" button\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/SecondaryCTA.tsx:22,59` - `variant=\"primary\" size=\"lg\"` for secondary CTA\n\n---\n\n#### 2.

Customization happens at call sites:\n\n**Call Site Customization** (`FAQ.tsx`):\n```tsx\n// Lines 52-67\n<Accordion type=\"single\" collapsible className=\"space-y-2\">\n  <AccordionItem className=\"border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 px-4\">\n    <AccordionTrigger className=\"text-left text-black dark:text-white hover:no-underline py-4\">\n      {faq.question}\n    </AccordionTrigger>\n    <AccordionContent className=\"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 pb-4\">\n      {faq.answer}\n    </AccordionContent>\n  </AccordionItem>\n</Accordion>\n```\n\n**Why No Wrapper**:\n- Only one usage location (`FAQ.tsx`)\n- Brand-specific styling applied directly via `className` props\n- No repeated pattern that would benefit from abstraction\n\n---\n\n### Design System Compliance\n\n**Brand Requirements** (from `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/docs/design-system.md` and `CLAUDE.md`):\n- Sharp corners: `rounded-none` (0px border radius)\n- High contrast borders: `border-black dark:border-white`\n- Plus corner signature element\n- Semantic color pairing for light/dark modes\n\n**Component Compliance**:\n\n| Component | Border Radius | Dark Mode | Plus Corners | Notes |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| Button | ✓ `rounded-none` | ✓ All variants | N/A | Lines 21, 23, 25, 27 |\n| PlusCornerCard | ✓ Implicit (no radius) | ✓ Border + corners | ✓ Signature element | Lines 33-42 |\n| Container | N/A (layout) | N/A | N/A | Pure layout wrapper |\n| InfiniteSlider | N/A (animation) | N/A | N/A | Animation utility |\n| Accordion | ⚠️ Uses ShadCN defaults | ✓ At call site | N/A | No wrapper to enforce |\n\n**Accordion Compliance Gap**:\n- ShadCN's default `accordion.tsx` doesn't enforce `rounded-none`\n- Compliance depends on developer remembering to add brand classes at call site\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/FAQ.tsx:57` manually adds brand borders but doesn't override radius\n\n---\n\n### Utility Function: cn()\n\n**Location**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/lib/utils.ts`\n\n**Implementation**:\n- Lines 1-2: Imports `clsx` and `extendTailwindMerge`\n- Lines 5-42: Custom Tailwind Merge configuration extending semantic color classes\n- Lines 8-18: Background color class group including `bg-background`, `bg-primary`, etc.\n- Lines 19-32: Text color class group for semantic tokens\n- Lines 33-39: Border color class group\n- Lines 44-46: Exported `cn()` function combining `clsx` and extended `twMerge`\n\n**Extended Class Groups**:\n```typescript\nclassGroups: {\n  \"bg-color\": [\"bg-background\", \"bg-foreground\", \"bg-primary\", ...],\n  \"text-color\": [\"text-foreground\", \"text-primary-foreground\", ...],\n  \"border-color\": [\"border-border\", \"border-input\", ...]\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Enables proper merging of ShadCN semantic color classes with conflicting Tailwind utilities\n\n**Usage Pattern**:\n- `PlusCornerCard.tsx:1,30` - Imported and used for conditional border styling\n- `Button.tsx` does NOT use `cn()` - uses manual string concatenation (line 37)\n- `accordion.tsx:7,18,37` - Used throughout ShadCN component\n\n---\n\n### Component Import Patterns\n\n**Import Analysis** (from grep results):\n\nAll UI component imports follow consistent pattern:\n```tsx\nimport { ComponentName } from \"./ui/ComponentName\";\n// or\nimport { ComponentName } from \"../ui/ComponentName\";  // From bento/\n```\n\n**Usage Frequency**:\n- `Container`: 7 imports across all sections\n- `Button`: 3 imports (Hero, Header, SecondaryCTA)\n- `PlusCornerCard`: 3 imports (2 in bento/, 1 in BentoFeatures)\n- `InfiniteSlider`: 1 import (TeamCredentialsSection)\n- `Accordion` components: 1 import block (FAQ)\n\n**No Global Exports**:\n- No `index.ts` barrel export in `ui/` directory\n- Each component imported individually\n- Prevents accidental usage of non-brand components\n\n---\n\n### CSS Animation Integration\n\n**Global Styles** (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/globals.css`):\n\n**Circuit Board Animations** (Lines 101-186):\n- 10 individual `.circuit-signal-N` classes with unique `offset-path` values\n- Animation duration: 3-5 seconds per path\n- Staggered delays: 1.5s - 2.5s\n- Uses `offset-distance` and `opacity` for signal travel effect\n- Referenced in `IntegrationsCard.tsx:93-122`\n\n**Infinite Scroll Animations** (Lines 257-282):\n- `@keyframes scroll` and `scroll-reverse`\n- Applied via `.animate-scroll` and `.animate-scroll-reverse` classes\n- Used by `InfiniteSlider.tsx:33`\n\n**ShadCN Accordion Animations**:\n- No custom keyframes in globals.css\n- Uses Radix UI data attributes: `data-[state=open]:animate-accordion-down`\n- Animation classes likely defined in ShadCN's tw-animate-css import (line 2)\n\n---\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n\n**1. Manual vs Utility Composition**:\n- `Button.tsx:37` uses manual string concatenation: `` `${baseStyles} ${variants[variant]} ${sizes[size]} ${className}` ``\n- `PlusCornerCard.tsx:30` uses `cn()` utility for conditional logic\n- Inconsistent pattern across custom components\n\n**2. Dark Mode Implementation**:\n- All custom components use inline Tailwind dark mode classes\n- Pattern: `text-black dark:text-white`\n- No separate dark mode component variants\n- Dark mode activated via `.dark` class on root (globals.css:223)\n\n**3. TypeScript Patterns**:\n- Button uses `ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>` extension\n- PlusCornerCard and Container use explicit interface definitions\n- InfiniteSlider uses type alias instead of interface\n- Accordion uses `React.ComponentProps<typeof Primitive>` type inference\n\n**4. Client Component Directives**:\n- `InfiniteSlider.tsx:1` - Requires client for animation state\n- `accordion.tsx:1` - Required by Radix UI primitives\n- `Button.tsx` - No directive (can be server-rendered)\n- `PlusCornerCard.tsx` - No directive (can be server-rendered)\n\n---\n\n### Summary Data\n\n**Component Count**: 5 total\n- Custom brand components: 3 (Button, PlusCornerCard, Container)\n- Animation utilities: 1 (InfiniteSlider)\n- ShadCN components: 1 (Accordion)\n\n**Wrapper Pattern**: Not implemented\n- Expected pattern documented in CLAUDE.md\n- Actual implementation: Direct customization at call sites\n- Reason: Single usage location doesn't justify abstraction\n\n**Design System Enforcement**:\n- Strong enforcement: Custom components (`Button`, `PlusCornerCard`)\n- Weak enforcement: ShadCN components (relies on developer memory)\n- No automated enforcement mechanism (no wrapper layer)\n\n**File Paths** (all absolute):\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/Button.tsx`\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx`\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/Container.tsx`\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/InfiniteSlider.tsx`\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/accordion.tsx`"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a556e30 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"uuid":"4dc9c102-017a-4cc9-89c7-fdef37feef8b","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:07:41.718Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Analyze the UI components in src/components/ui/ and how they're used across the landing page.

Five components exist in `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/`: three custom brand components (`Button.tsx`, `PlusCornerCard.tsx`, `Container.tsx`), one animation utility (`InfiniteSlider.tsx`), and one ShadCN-installed component (`accordion.tsx`). No wrapper pattern is implemented—the ShadCN accordion is customized directly in consuming components rather than through a branded wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### UI Components Inventory\n\n#### 1. Button Component (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/Button.tsx`)\n\n**Type**: Custom brand component\n\n**Implementation Pattern**:\n- Lines 3-7: TypeScript interface extending `ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>`\n- Lines 5-6: Supports 4 variants (`primary`, `solid`, `secondary`, `ghost`) and 2 sizes (`default`, `lg`)\n- Lines 16-17: Base styles include focus ring, transitions, cursor pointer\n- Lines 19-28: Variant styles object with hardcoded dark mode classes\n- Lines 30-33: Size styles object defining height and padding\n- Line 37: Manual string concatenation for className composition (not using `cn()`)\n\n**Variant Specifications**:\n| Variant | Background | Text | Border | Border Radius |\n|---------|-----------|------|--------|---------------|\n| `primary` | `bg-background` | `text-black dark:text-white` | `border-black dark:border-white` | `rounded-none` |\n| `solid` | `bg-black dark:bg-white` | `text-white dark:text-black` | `border-black dark:border-white` | `rounded-none` |\n| `secondary` | `bg-transparent` | `text-black dark:text-white` | `border-black dark:border-white` | `rounded-none` |\n| `ghost` | `bg-transparent` | `text-black dark:text-white` | `border-transparent hover:border-zinc-200/700` | `rounded-none` |\n\n**Usage Across Landing Page**:\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/Hero.tsx:78` - `variant=\"solid\" size=\"lg\"` for \"Join the Waitlist\" CTA\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/Header.tsx:53` - `variant=\"secondary\" size=\"default\"` for \"Login\" button\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/SecondaryCTA.tsx:22,59` - `variant=\"primary\" size=\"lg\"` for secondary CTA\n\n---\n\n#### 2. PlusCornerCard Component (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx`)\n\n**Type**: Custom brand signature component\n\n**Implementation Pattern**:\n- Lines 9-21: Internal `PlusCorner` SVG component rendering a plus sign (`+`) icon\n- Lines 3-7: Props interface accepting `children`, `className`, and `dashed` boolean\n- Lines 30-37: Container with conditional border styling based on `dashed` prop\n- Lines 39-42: Four absolutely positioned `PlusCorner` instances at each corner\n- Line 39-42: Corner positioning using negative values (`-top-2.5 -left-2.5`) and muted colors\n\n**Corner Positioning Logic**:\n```tsx\n// Line 39: Top-left\n<PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n// Line 40: Top-right\n<PlusCorner className=\"absolute -top-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n// Line 41: Bottom-left\n<PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -left-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n// Line 42: Bottom-right\n<PlusCorner className=\"absolute -bottom-2.5 -right-2.5 w-5 h-5 text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-600\" />\n```\n\n**Border Styling Logic**:\n- Line 32-34: Ternary operator switches between `border-dashed` and solid `border` based on `dashed` prop\n- Default value: `dashed = true` (line 26)\n\n**Usage Across Landing Page**:\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/bento/IntegrationsCard.tsx:9` - Wraps integrations circuit board (2x2 grid span)\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/bento/DataVaultCard.tsx:17` - Wraps data vault 3D folder (1x2 grid span, explicit `dashed={true}`)\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx:41` - \"Human in the Loop\" card (1x1 grid)\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx:54` - \"Never Miss a Task\" card (1x1 grid)\n\n**Duplication Pattern**:\nThe `PlusCorner` SVG component is duplicated inline in three other files rather than being exported/reused:\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/Hero.tsx:9-21` - Identical implementation\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx:13-25` - Identical implementation\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/FlowSection.tsx:66-101` - Four inline SVG instances instead of component\n\n---\n\n#### 3.

Customization happens at call sites:\n\n**Call Site Customization** (`FAQ.tsx`):\n```tsx\n// Lines 52-67\n<Accordion type=\"single\" collapsible className=\"space-y-2\">\n  <AccordionItem className=\"border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 px-4\">\n    <AccordionTrigger className=\"text-left text-black dark:text-white hover:no-underline py-4\">\n      {faq.question}\n    </AccordionTrigger>\n    <AccordionContent className=\"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 pb-4\">\n      {faq.answer}\n    </AccordionContent>\n  </AccordionItem>\n</Accordion>\n```\n\n**Why No Wrapper**:\n- Only one usage location (`FAQ.tsx`)\n- Brand-specific styling applied directly via `className` props\n- No repeated pattern that would benefit from abstraction\n\n---\n\n### Design System Compliance\n\n**Brand Requirements** (from `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/docs/design-system.md` and `CLAUDE.md`):\n- Sharp corners: `rounded-none` (0px border radius)\n- High contrast borders: `border-black dark:border-white`\n- Plus corner signature element\n- Semantic color pairing for light/dark modes\n\n**Component Compliance**:\n\n| Component | Border Radius | Dark Mode | Plus Corners | Notes |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| Button | ✓ `rounded-none` | ✓ All variants | N/A | Lines 21, 23, 25, 27 |\n| PlusCornerCard | ✓ Implicit (no radius) | ✓ Border + corners | ✓ Signature element | Lines 33-42 |\n| Container | N/A (layout) | N/A | N/A | Pure layout wrapper |\n| InfiniteSlider | N/A (animation) | N/A | N/A | Animation utility |\n| Accordion | ⚠️ Uses ShadCN defaults | ✓ At call site | N/A | No wrapper to enforce |\n\n**Accordion Compliance Gap**:\n- ShadCN's default `accordion.tsx` doesn't enforce `rounded-none`\n- Compliance depends on developer remembering to add brand classes at call site\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/FAQ.tsx:57` manually adds brand borders but doesn't override radius\n\n---\n\n### Utility Function: cn()\n\n**Location**: `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/lib/utils.ts`\n\n**Implementation**:\n- Lines 1-2: Imports `clsx` and `extendTailwindMerge`\n- Lines 5-42: Custom Tailwind Merge configuration extending semantic color classes\n- Lines 8-18: Background color class group including `bg-background`, `bg-primary`, etc.\n- Lines 19-32: Text color class group for semantic tokens\n- Lines 33-39: Border color class group\n- Lines 44-46: Exported `cn()` function combining `clsx` and extended `twMerge`\n\n**Extended Class Groups**:\n```typescript\nclassGroups: {\n  \"bg-color\": [\"bg-background\", \"bg-foreground\", \"bg-primary\", ...],\n  \"text-color\": [\"text-foreground\", \"text-primary-foreground\", ...],\n  \"border-color\": [\"border-border\", \"border-input\", ...]\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Enables proper merging of ShadCN semantic color classes with conflicting Tailwind utilities\n\n**Usage Pattern**:\n- `PlusCornerCard.tsx:1,30` - Imported and used for conditional border styling\n- `Button.tsx` does NOT use `cn()` - uses manual string concatenation (line 37)\n- `accordion.tsx:7,18,37` - Used throughout ShadCN component\n\n---\n\n### Component Import Patterns\n\n**Import Analysis** (from grep results):\n\nAll UI component imports follow consistent pattern:\n```tsx\nimport { ComponentName } from \"./ui/ComponentName\";\n// or\nimport { ComponentName } from \"../ui/ComponentName\";  // From bento/\n```\n\n**Usage Frequency**:\n- `Container`: 7 imports across all sections\n- `Button`: 3 imports (Hero, Header, SecondaryCTA)\n- `PlusCornerCard`: 3 imports (2 in bento/, 1 in BentoFeatures)\n- `InfiniteSlider`: 1 import (TeamCredentialsSection)\n- `Accordion` components: 1 import block (FAQ)\n\n**No Global Exports**:\n- No `index.ts` barrel export in `ui/` directory\n- Each component imported individually\n- Prevents accidental usage of non-brand components\n\n---\n\n### CSS Animation Integration\n\n**Global Styles** (`/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/app/globals.css`):\n\n**Circuit Board Animations** (Lines 101-186):\n- 10 individual `.circuit-signal-N` classes with unique `offset-path` values\n- Animation duration: 3-5 seconds per path\n- Staggered delays: 1.5s - 2.5s\n- Uses `offset-distance` and `opacity` for signal travel effect\n- Referenced in `IntegrationsCard.tsx:93-122`\n\n**Infinite Scroll Animations** (Lines 257-282):\n- `@keyframes scroll` and `scroll-reverse`\n- Applied via `.animate-scroll` and `.animate-scroll-reverse` classes\n- Used by `InfiniteSlider.tsx:33`\n\n**ShadCN Accordion Animations**:\n- No custom keyframes in globals.css\n- Uses Radix UI data attributes: `data-[state=open]:animate-accordion-down`\n- Animation classes likely defined in ShadCN's tw-animate-css import (line 2)\n\n---\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n\n**1. Manual vs Utility Composition**:\n- `Button.tsx:37` uses manual string concatenation: `` `${baseStyles} ${variants[variant]} ${sizes[size]} ${className}` ``\n- `PlusCornerCard.tsx:30` uses `cn()` utility for conditional logic\n- Inconsistent pattern across custom components\n\n**2. Dark Mode Implementation**:\n- All custom components use inline Tailwind dark mode classes\n- Pattern: `text-black dark:text-white`\n- No separate dark mode component variants\n- Dark mode activated via `.dark` class on root (globals.css:223)\n\n**3. TypeScript Patterns**:\n- Button uses `ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>` extension\n- PlusCornerCard and Container use explicit interface definitions\n- InfiniteSlider uses type alias instead of interface\n- Accordion uses `React.ComponentProps<typeof Primitive>` type inference\n\n**4. Client Component Directives**:\n- `InfiniteSlider.tsx:1` - Requires client for animation state\n- `accordion.tsx:1` - Required by Radix UI primitives\n- `Button.tsx` - No directive (can be server-rendered)\n- `PlusCornerCard.tsx` - No directive (can be server-rendered)\n\n---\n\n### Summary Data\n\n**Component Count**: 5 total\n- Custom brand components: 3 (Button, PlusCornerCard, Container)\n- Animation utilities: 1 (InfiniteSlider)\n- ShadCN components: 1 (Accordion)\n\n**Wrapper Pattern**: Not implemented\n- Expected pattern documented in CLAUDE.md\n- Actual implementation: Direct customization at call sites\n- Reason: Single usage location doesn't justify abstraction\n\n**Design System Enforcement**:\n- Strong enforcement: Custom components (`Button`, `PlusCornerCard`)\n- Weak enforcement: ShadCN components (relies on developer memory)\n- No automated enforcement mechanism (no wrapper layer)\n\n**File Paths** (all absolute):\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/Button.tsx`\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx`\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/Container.tsx`\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/InfiniteSlider.tsx`\n- `/Users/ia/Documents/code/@orgs/my-entourage/entourage-web/src/components/ui/accordion.tsx`"}],"totalDurationMs":155818,"totalTokens":44008,"totalToolUseCount":28,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":172,"cache_read_input_tokens":38056,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":172,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":5774,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

Let me synthesize the findings and create improvement suggestions. The user explicitly asked for improvements, so I should now:\n\n1. Mark the first todo as complete\n2. Update to comparing implementation against design system\n3. Document findings and suggest improvements\n\nKey findings from the research:\n\n**Strengths (already compliant)**:\n- Dark mode pairing is 100% consistent\n- `rounded-none` used everywhere (Technical Blueprint aesthetic)\n- Section and container padding follow design system\n- Plus corner system well-implemented\n- Typography patterns (font-mono, tracking) mostly align\n- Border patterns are correct\n\n**Issues/Gaps identified**:\n\n1. **Accent colors not used**: Design system documents emerald-500, violet-500, amber-500, rose-500, sky-500 but they're not used. Only one `green-500` instance found (should be emerald-500).\n\n2. **PlusCorner duplication**: The PlusCorner SVG component is duplicated inline in Hero.tsx, TeamCredentialsSection.tsx, FlowSection.tsx instead of being exported/reused from PlusCornerCard.tsx.\n\n3. **Button.tsx doesn't use cn()**: Uses manual string concatenation instead of the cn() utility.\n\n4. **No ShadCN wrappers**: The accordion component is used directly without a wrapper to enforce brand styling. The design system and CLAUDE.md explicitly document the wrapper pattern.\n\n5. **Tracking inconsistency**: Most labels use `tracking-wider` but one uses `tracking-widest` (TeamCredentialsSection).\n\n6. **Loading state not documented**: Button has `loading` prop but no usage found on landing page.\n\n7. **Interactive Plus corners not used**: Design system documents hover enhancement for Plus corners but current implementation is static.\n\nLet me create a comprehensive improvement list for the user.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4667,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8506,"cache_read_input_tokens":47399,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":8506,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWVMGbB494vuDsSRgQems","type":"assistant","uuid":"ef1c78bc-e7e0-4a56-922e-9766137b379c","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:07:55.675Z"}

Consider adding accent colors to differentiate integrations, highlight AI-powered features, or add visual interest to the bento cards.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **PlusCorner Component Duplication** (Code Quality)\nThe PlusCorner SVG is duplicated inline in 3 files instead of reusing the one in `PlusCornerCard.tsx`:\n- `src/components/Hero.tsx:9-21`\n- `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx:13-25`\n- `src/components/FlowSection.tsx:66-101`\n\n**Recommendation**: Export `PlusCorner` from `src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx` and import it where needed.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Missing ShadCN Wrapper Pattern** (Per CLAUDE.md)\nThe Accordion is used directly without a wrapper to enforce brand styling:\n\n```tsx\n// Current (FAQ.tsx) - customization at call site\n<AccordionItem className=\"border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 px-4\">\n```\n\n**Recommendation**: Create `src/components/Accordion.tsx` wrapper:\n```tsx\n// Enforces rounded-none and brand borders\nexport function AccordionItem({ className, ...props }) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnAccordionItem\n      className={cn(\"rounded-none border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800\", className)}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Button.tsx Not Using cn() Utility** (Code Quality)\nThe Button component uses manual string concatenation:\n```tsx\n// Current (line 37)\nclassName={`${baseStyles} ${variants[variant]} ${sizes[size]} ${className}`}\n```\n\n**Recommendation**: Use `cn()` for proper class merging:\n```tsx\nclassName={cn(baseStyles, variants[variant], sizes[size], className)}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Interactive Plus Corners Not Implemented** (Enhancement)\nDesign system documents hover enhancement for Plus corners:\n```tsx\n// From design system - not currently used\nclassName=\"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n```\n\n**Recommendation**: Add `interactive` prop to `PlusCornerCard` (already in design system spec) and use it on hoverable cards like the bento grid items.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Minor Tracking Inconsistency** (Polish)\nMost labels use `tracking-wider` but one uses `tracking-widest`:\n- `TeamCredentialsSection.tsx:54` uses `tracking-widest`\n- All others use `tracking-wider`\n\n**Recommendation**: Standardize to `tracking-wider` per design system.\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Missing Visual Hierarchy with Color** (Enhancement)\nThe landing page is almost entirely monochromatic. While this aligns with the \"Technical Blueprint\" aesthetic, the design system explicitly provides accent colors for:\n- Highlighting AI-powered features (emerald)\n- Differentiating integration categories (violet)\n- Drawing attention to CTAs or benefits (sky)\n\n**Recommendation**: Strategic use of accent colors could:\n- Make the \"Join the Waitlist\" CTA more prominent\n- Highlight the AI processing core in FlowSection\n- Add color to integration icons or categories\n- Create visual rhythm in the bento grid\n\n---\n\n### Summary Priority Matrix\n\n| Priority | Improvement | Effort |\n|----------|-------------|--------|\n| **High** | Add accent colors strategically | Medium |\n| **Medium** | Extract PlusCorner component | Low |\n| **Medium** | Create Accordion wrapper | Low |\n| **Low** | Fix Button cn() usage | Trivial |\n| **Low** | Add interactive Plus corners | Low |\n| **Low** | Fix tracking inconsistency | Trivial |\n\nWould you like me to implement any of these improvements?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5269,"cache_read_input_tokens":55905,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5269,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWVMHpdD9SnEjd531kwd1","type":"assistant","uuid":"239d20ea-32c1-49b0-a635-95ffedc3e1e2","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:08:33.049Z"}

You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n\n    - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n    - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n    - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n\n    - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n    - Research documents\n    - Related implementation plans\n    - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n    - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n    - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n    - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**: Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n    - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n    - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n    - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n    - If a Linear ticket is mentioned, use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details\n\n    These agents will:\n\n    - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n    - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)\n    - Trace data flow and key functions\n    - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n\n    - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n    - Read them FULLY into the main context\n    - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n\n    - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n    - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n    - Note assumptions that need verification\n    - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n\n    ```\n    Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n    I've found that:\n    - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n    - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n    - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n    Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n    - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n    - [Business logic clarification]\n    - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n    ```\n\n    Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n\n    - DO NOT just accept the correction\n    - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n    - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n    - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n\n    - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n    - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n    **For deeper investigation:**\n\n    - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n    - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n    - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n    **For historical context:**\n\n    - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n    - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n    **For related tickets:**\n\n    - **linear-searcher** - To find similar issues or past implementations\n\n    Each agent knows how to:\n\n    - Find the right files and code patterns\n    - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n    - Look for integration points and dependencies\n    - Return specific file:line references\n    - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n\n    ```\n    Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n    **Current State:**\n    - [Key discovery about existing code]\n    - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n    **Design Options:**\n    1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n    2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n    **Open Questions:**\n    - [Technical uncertainty]\n    - [Design decision needed]\n\n    Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n    ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n\n    ```\n    Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n    ## Overview\n    [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n    ## Implementation Phases:\n    1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n    2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n    3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n    Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n    ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n    - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n        - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n        - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n        - description is a brief kebab-case description\n    - Examples:\n        - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n        - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-improve-error-handling.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n````markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n\n-   [Important finding with file:line reference]\n-   [Pattern to follow]\n-   [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext` **Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n-   [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n-   [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n-   [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n-   [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n-   [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n-   [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n-   [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n\n-   [What to test]\n-   [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n\n-   [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n-   Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n-   Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n-   Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n````\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n\n    - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the newly created plan\n    - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n\n    ```\n    I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n    `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n\n    Please review it and let me know:\n    - Are the phases properly scoped?\n    - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n    - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n    - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n    ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n\n    - Add missing phases\n    - Adjust technical approach\n    - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n    - Add/remove scope items\n    - After making changes, run `humanlayer thoughts sync` again\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n\n    - Question vague requirements\n    - Identify potential issues early\n    - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n    - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n\n    - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n    - Get buy-in at each major step\n    - Allow course corrections\n    - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n\n    - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n    - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n    - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n    - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n    - automated steps should use `make` whenever possible - for example `make -C humanlayer-wui check` instead of `cd humanlayer-wui && bun run fmt`\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n\n    - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n    - Consider migration and rollback\n    - Think about edge cases\n    - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n\n    - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n    - Update todos as you complete research\n    - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n    - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n    - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n    - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n    - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n    - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n\n    - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n    - Specific files that should exist\n    - Code compilation/type checking\n    - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n    - UI/UX functionality\n    - Performance under real conditions\n    - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n    - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n\n-   [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n-   [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n-   [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n-   [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n\n-   [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n-   [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n-   [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n-   [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n\n-   Start with schema/migration\n-   Add store methods\n-   Update business logic\n-   Expose via API\n-   Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n\n-   Research existing patterns first\n-   Start with data model\n-   Build backend logic\n-   Add API endpoints\n-   Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n\n-   Document current behavior\n-   Plan incremental changes\n-   Maintain backwards compatibility\n-   Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n    - Exactly what to search for\n    - Which directories to focus on\n    - What information to extract\n    - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n    - If the ticket mentions \"WUI\", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory\n    - If it mentions \"daemon\", specify `hld/` directory\n    - Never use generic terms like \"UI\" when you mean \"WUI\"\n    - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n    - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n    - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n    - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /create_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...\n\n[Interactive process continues...]\n```\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"a0f9b146-17d3-41f2-bda5-66d5e31efa81","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:15:58.134Z"}

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n- **Pause for human verification**: After completing all automated verification for a phase, pause and inform the human that the phase is ready for manual testing. Use this format:\n  ```\n  Phase [N] Complete - Ready for Manual Verification\n\n  Automated verification passed:\n  - [List automated checks that passed]\n\n  Please perform the manual verification steps listed in the plan:\n  - [List manual verification items from the plan]\n\n  Let me know when manual testing is complete so I can proceed to Phase [N+1].\n  ```\n\nIf instructed to execute multiple phases consecutively, skip the pause until the last phase. Otherwise, assume you are just doing one phase.\n\ndo not check off items in the manual testing steps until confirmed by the user.\n\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"af8e9954-4ab1-4537-ac33-aab0949af7df","timestamp":"2025-12-26T13:25:19.839Z"}

Each phase is small and testable.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Extract PlusCorner Component\n\n### Overview\nCreate a standalone, reusable PlusCorner component and update all files that duplicate it.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1.

Load landing page in browser\n2. Scroll through all sections verifying plus corners display\n3. Toggle dark mode and verify all elements adapt\n4. Hover over bento cards to verify interactive plus corners\n5. Open/close FAQ accordion items\n6. Verify buttons render correctly in all locations\n7. Check FlowSection checkmark is emerald colored\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- No performance impact expected\n- Shared PlusCorner component may slightly reduce bundle size (deduplication)\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration needed. These are purely frontend component changes.\n\n## References\n\n- Design System: `docs/design-system.md` (v6.0)\n- Previous evaluation: This conversation's earlier analysis\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":134,"oldLines":9,"newStart":134,"newLines":9,"lines":[" ### Success Criteria"," "," #### Automated Verification","-- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`","-- [ ] Linting passes: `pnpm lint`","-- [ ] No duplicate PlusCorner definitions in codebase","+- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`","+- [x] Linting passes: `pnpm lint` (pre-existing warnings unrelated to changes)","+- [x] No duplicate PlusCorner definitions in codebase"," "," #### Manual Verification"," - [ ] Plus corners display correctly on Hero section"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Internal PlusCorner exists but not exported\n- `src/components/Hero.tsx:9-21` - Duplicate PlusCorner\n- `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx:13-25` - Duplicate PlusCorner\n- `src/components/FlowSection.tsx:66-101` - 4 inline SVG plus corners\n- `src/components/ui/Button.tsx:37` - Template literal className\n- `src/components/FAQ.tsx:57` - Direct ShadCN usage with inline customization\n- `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx:54` - Uses `tracking-widest`\n- `src/components/FlowSection.tsx:160` - Uses `bg-green-500`\n\n## Desired End State\n\nA landing page that fully adheres to design system v6.0:\n- Single source of truth for PlusCorner component with optional interactivity\n- All UI components using proper `cn()` utility for class composition\n- ShadCN components wrapped with brand styling enforcement\n- Consistent typography (tracking, font-mono usage)\n- Strategic use of accent colors (emerald for AI/success)\n\n### Verification\n- `pnpm build` passes without errors\n- `pnpm lint` passes\n- Visual inspection shows no regressions\n- Plus corners animate on hover where `interactive` is enabled\n- Accent colors visible in appropriate contexts\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Adding new sections or features to the landing page\n- Changing the overall layout or structure\n- Modifying ShadCN base components directly\n- Adding all 5 accent colors everywhere (just strategic use of emerald)\n- Creating wrappers for ShadCN components not yet installed\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nIncremental phases that can each be verified independently. Each phase is small and testable.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Extract PlusCorner Component\n\n### Overview\nCreate a standalone, reusable PlusCorner component and update all files that duplicate it.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Create new PlusCorner component\n\n**File**: `src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx` (new)\n\n```tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerProps {\n  className?: string;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nexport function PlusCorner({ className, interactive = false }: PlusCornerProps) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={cn(\n        className,\n        interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n      )}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Update PlusCornerCard to use shared component\n\n**File**: `src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx`\n\n- Remove internal PlusCorner function (lines 9-21)\n- Import from `./PlusCorner`\n- Add `interactive` prop to interface and pass through to PlusCorner instances\n- Add `group` class to container when interactive\n\n#### 3.

Internal PlusCorner exists but not exported\n- `src/components/Hero.tsx:9-21` - Duplicate PlusCorner\n- `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx:13-25` - Duplicate PlusCorner\n- `src/components/FlowSection.tsx:66-101` - 4 inline SVG plus corners\n- `src/components/ui/Button.tsx:37` - Template literal className\n- `src/components/FAQ.tsx:57` - Direct ShadCN usage with inline customization\n- `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx:54` - Uses `tracking-widest`\n- `src/components/FlowSection.tsx:160` - Uses `bg-green-500`\n\n## Desired End State\n\nA landing page that fully adheres to design system v6.0:\n- Single source of truth for PlusCorner component with optional interactivity\n- All UI components using proper `cn()` utility for class composition\n- ShadCN components wrapped with brand styling enforcement\n- Consistent typography (tracking, font-mono usage)\n- Strategic use of accent colors (emerald for AI/success)\n\n### Verification\n- `pnpm build` passes without errors\n- `pnpm lint` passes\n- Visual inspection shows no regressions\n- Plus corners animate on hover where `interactive` is enabled\n- Accent colors visible in appropriate contexts\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Adding new sections or features to the landing page\n- Changing the overall layout or structure\n- Modifying ShadCN base components directly\n- Adding all 5 accent colors everywhere (just strategic use of emerald)\n- Creating wrappers for ShadCN components not yet installed\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nIncremental phases that can each be verified independently. Each phase is small and testable.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Extract PlusCorner Component\n\n### Overview\nCreate a standalone, reusable PlusCorner component and update all files that duplicate it.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1.

Internal PlusCorner exists but not exported\n- `src/components/Hero.tsx:9-21` - Duplicate PlusCorner\n- `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx:13-25` - Duplicate PlusCorner\n- `src/components/FlowSection.tsx:66-101` - 4 inline SVG plus corners\n- `src/components/ui/Button.tsx:37` - Template literal className\n- `src/components/FAQ.tsx:57` - Direct ShadCN usage with inline customization\n- `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx:54` - Uses `tracking-widest`\n- `src/components/FlowSection.tsx:160` - Uses `bg-green-500`\n\n## Desired End State\n\nA landing page that fully adheres to design system v6.0:\n- Single source of truth for PlusCorner component with optional interactivity\n- All UI components using proper `cn()` utility for class composition\n- ShadCN components wrapped with brand styling enforcement\n- Consistent typography (tracking, font-mono usage)\n- Strategic use of accent colors (emerald for AI/success)\n\n### Verification\n- `pnpm build` passes without errors\n- `pnpm lint` passes\n- Visual inspection shows no regressions\n- Plus corners animate on hover where `interactive` is enabled\n- Accent colors visible in appropriate contexts\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Adding new sections or features to the landing page\n- Changing the overall layout or structure\n- Modifying ShadCN base components directly\n- Adding all 5 accent colors everywhere (just strategic use of emerald)\n- Creating wrappers for ShadCN components not yet installed\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nIncremental phases that can each be verified independently. Each phase is small and testable.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Extract PlusCorner Component\n\n### Overview\nCreate a standalone, reusable PlusCorner component and update all files that duplicate it.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1.

Uses `tracking-widest`\n- `src/components/FlowSection.tsx:160` - Uses `bg-green-500`\n\n## Desired End State\n\nA landing page that fully adheres to design system v6.0:\n- Single source of truth for PlusCorner component with optional interactivity\n- All UI components using proper `cn()` utility for class composition\n- ShadCN components wrapped with brand styling enforcement\n- Consistent typography (tracking, font-mono usage)\n- Strategic use of accent colors (emerald for AI/success)\n\n### Verification\n- `pnpm build` passes without errors\n- `pnpm lint` passes\n- Visual inspection shows no regressions\n- Plus corners animate on hover where `interactive` is enabled\n- Accent colors visible in appropriate contexts\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Adding new sections or features to the landing page\n- Changing the overall layout or structure\n- Modifying ShadCN base components directly\n- Adding all 5 accent colors everywhere (just strategic use of emerald)\n- Creating wrappers for ShadCN components not yet installed\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nIncremental phases that can each be verified independently. Each phase is small and testable.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Extract PlusCorner Component\n\n### Overview\nCreate a standalone, reusable PlusCorner component and update all files that duplicate it.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Create new PlusCorner component\n\n**File**: `src/components/ui/PlusCorner.tsx` (new)\n\n```tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n\ninterface PlusCornerProps {\n  className?: string;\n  interactive?: boolean;\n}\n\nexport function PlusCorner({ className, interactive = false }: PlusCornerProps) {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      className={cn(\n        className,\n        interactive && \"transition-colors duration-150 group-hover:text-zinc-500 dark:group-hover:text-zinc-500\"\n      )}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n      fill=\"none\"\n      stroke=\"currentColor\"\n      strokeWidth=\"1\"\n    >\n      <path d=\"M12 6v12m6-6H6\" />\n    </svg>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Update PlusCornerCard to use shared component\n\n**File**: `src/components/ui/PlusCornerCard.tsx`\n\n- Remove internal PlusCorner function (lines 9-21)\n- Import from `./PlusCorner`\n- Add `interactive` prop to interface and pass through to PlusCorner instances\n- Add `group` class to container when interactive\n\n#### 3.

Update Button component\n\n**File**: `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`\n\nAdd import for cn:\n```tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\n```\n\nReplace line 37:\n```tsx\n// Before\nclassName={`${baseStyles} ${variants[variant]} ${sizes[size]} ${className}`}\n\n// After\nclassName={cn(baseStyles, variants[variant], sizes[size], className)}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification\n- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [x] Linting passes: `pnpm lint` (pre-existing issues unrelated)\n\n#### Manual Verification\n- [ ] All button variants render correctly (primary, solid, secondary, ghost)\n- [ ] Custom className props still merge correctly\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause for manual confirmation before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Create Accordion Wrapper\n\n### Overview\nCreate a brand wrapper for the ShadCN Accordion that enforces design system styling.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Create Accordion wrapper\n\n**File**: `src/components/Accordion.tsx` (new)\n\n```tsx\nimport {\n  Accordion as ShadcnAccordion,\n  AccordionContent as ShadcnAccordionContent,\n  AccordionItem as ShadcnAccordionItem,\n  AccordionTrigger as ShadcnAccordionTrigger,\n} from \"@/components/ui/accordion\";\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport type { ComponentProps } from \"react\";\n\ntype AccordionProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnAccordion>;\ntype AccordionItemProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnAccordionItem>;\ntype AccordionTriggerProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnAccordionTrigger>;\ntype AccordionContentProps = ComponentProps<typeof ShadcnAccordionContent>;\n\nexport function Accordion({ className, ...props }: AccordionProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnAccordion\n      className={cn(\"space-y-2\", className)}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nexport function AccordionItem({ className, ...props }: AccordionItemProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnAccordionItem\n      className={cn(\n        \"rounded-none border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 px-4\",\n        className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nexport function AccordionTrigger({ className, ...props }: AccordionTriggerProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnAccordionTrigger\n      className={cn(\n        \"text-left text-black dark:text-white hover:no-underline py-4\",\n        className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nexport function AccordionContent({ className, ...props }: AccordionContentProps) {\n  return (\n    <ShadcnAccordionContent\n      className={cn(\n        \"text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 pb-4\",\n        className\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Update FAQ to use wrapper\n\n**File**: `src/components/FAQ.tsx`\n\nChange import from:\n```tsx\nimport {\n  Accordion,\n  AccordionContent,\n  AccordionItem,\n  AccordionTrigger,\n} from \"@/components/ui/accordion\";\n```\n\nTo:\n```tsx\nimport {\n  Accordion,\n  AccordionContent,\n  AccordionItem,\n  AccordionTrigger,\n} from \"@/components/Accordion\";\n```\n\nRemove inline styling from JSX (lines 52-65) since wrapper handles it.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification\n- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [x] Linting passes: `pnpm lint` (pre-existing issues unrelated)\n\n#### Manual Verification\n- [ ] FAQ accordion opens/closes correctly\n- [ ] FAQ styling matches previous appearance\n- [ ] Dark mode works for FAQ section\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause for manual confirmation before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Fix Minor Inconsistencies\n\n### Overview\nFix tracking inconsistency and wrong accent color.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Fix tracking in TeamCredentialsSection\n\n**File**: `src/components/TeamCredentialsSection.tsx`\n\nLine 54: Change `tracking-widest` to `tracking-wider`:\n```tsx\n// Before\n<span className=\"bg-background px-4 text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-widest text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n\n// After\n<span className=\"bg-background px-4 text-xs font-mono uppercase tracking-wider text-zinc-400 dark:text-zinc-500\">\n```\n\n#### 2. Fix accent color in FlowSection\n\n**File**: `src/components/FlowSection.tsx`\n\nLine 160: Change `bg-green-500` to `bg-emerald-500`:\n```tsx\n// Before\n<div className=\"w-4 h-4 bg-green-500 flex items-center justify-center\">\n\n// After\n<div className=\"w-4 h-4 bg-emerald-500 flex items-center justify-center\">\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification\n- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [x] Linting passes: `pnpm lint` (pre-existing issues unrelated)\n- [x] No instances of `tracking-widest` in section labels\n- [x] No instances of `green-500` (should use emerald-500)\n\n#### Manual Verification\n- [ ] TeamCredentialsSection label spacing looks consistent\n- [ ] FlowSection checkmark is emerald green (not generic green)\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause for manual confirmation before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Enable Interactive Plus Corners\n\n### Overview\nApply the interactive prop to appropriate PlusCornerCard instances.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Update bento cards to be interactive\n\n**File**: `src/components/BentoFeatures.tsx`\n\nAdd `interactive` prop to PlusCornerCard instances that are in the grid:\n```tsx\n<PlusCornerCard interactive className=\"...\">\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification\n- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `pnpm lint`\n\n#### Manual Verification\n- [ ] Hovering over bento cards causes plus corners to change color\n- [ ] Transition is smooth (150ms)\n- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause for manual confirmation before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\nNo unit tests needed - these are styling/component organization changes.\n\n### Integration Tests\nNot applicable for styling changes.\n\n### Manual Testing Steps\n1. Load landing page in browser\n2. Scroll through all sections verifying plus corners display\n3. Toggle dark mode and verify all elements adapt\n4. Hover over bento cards to verify interactive plus corners\n5. Open/close FAQ accordion items\n6. Verify buttons render correctly in all locations\n7. Check FlowSection checkmark is emerald colored\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- No performance impact expected\n- Shared PlusCorner component may slightly reduce bundle size (deduplication)\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration needed. These are purely frontend component changes.\n\n## References\n\n- Design System: `docs/design-system.md` (v6.0)\n- Previous evaluation: This conversation's earlier analysis\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":369,"oldLines":8,"newStart":369,"newLines":8,"lines":[" ### Success Criteria"," "," #### Automated Verification","-- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`","-- [ ] Linting passes: `pnpm lint`","+- [x] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm build`","+- [x] Linting passes: `pnpm lint` (pre-existing issues unrelated)"," "," #### Manual Verification"," - [ ] Hovering over bento cards causes plus corners to change color"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}
